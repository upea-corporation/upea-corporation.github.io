        <h2>UPEA Corp. Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>This website is hosted on Netlify, a web development and hosting platform. As such, the management of certain cookies and tracking technologies is handled through Netlify's infrastructure. Below, we explain the use of cookies on our website.</p>

        <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser when you visit certain websites. They are commonly used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the site owners.</p>

        <h3>Cookies managed by Netlify</h3>
        <p>Netlify, as a hosting provider, may use certain cookies for the proper functioning of the site, performance optimization, and security. These may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential or technical cookies:</strong> These are strictly necessary for the user to navigate the website and use the different options or services that exist on it. For example, allowing data communication, identifying the session, accessing restricted areas, among others. These cookies do not require consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance or analytical cookies:</strong> Netlify may use cookies to collect anonymous information about how visitors interact with the site (e.g., pages visited, time spent, errors). This information is used to improve the functionality and performance of the site. It is important to note that these cookies are anonymous and do not identify the individual user.</li>
            <li><strong>Security cookies:</strong> To protect the website and its users from potential threats, Netlify may use security-related cookies, such as those that detect unusual activities or prevent DDoS attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the cookies managed by Netlify, it is important to note that when you use our registration forms (ZAE, Employee, Feedback, etc.) hosted on <strong>Google Forms</strong>, this third-party service may also set its own cookies. Google Forms uses cookies for the proper functioning of its forms, performance improvement, and security. These may include essential, performance or analytical, and security cookies, similar to those managed by Netlify.</p>

        <h3>Our use of cookies</h3>
        <p>At UPEA Corp., our goal is to minimize the use of non-essential cookies and respect your privacy. The cookies that may be present on this website are primarily those managed by Netlify's infrastructure and those that may be set by <strong>Google Forms</strong> through our forms. We do not use third-party marketing or advertising cookies directly on this site.</p>

        <h3>Cookie control</h3>
        <p>You have the option to configure your browser to notify you about the reception of cookies and, if you wish, prevent their installation on your computer. You can also delete cookies already stored on your device. For more information on how to manage cookies, you can consult your browser's help function or visit sites like <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" class="footer-link">allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
