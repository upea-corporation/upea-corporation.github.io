                <h3>General Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Toxer is a colossal protogen with an imposing appearance and advanced biotechnology, described as a <span class="censored-text">17 z19lh1B418 1As r19t19h17y q41817h1B418, j19yr 17119z17y 171r y19i191t j181721A1.</span> He has a height of 3.65 meters and weighs 1,400 kg. His constitution is extremely bulky and muscular, with a robust tank-like structure, optimized for heavy combat and extreme resistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding his colors and materials, his main tone is intense and bright green, with neon variations in areas such as the core, visible veins, and joints. His visor, wolf-shaped, features sharp details and fangs, and a penetrating greenish gaze with toxic glows, frequently displaying digital threat expressions or icons. His body surface is mainly <span class="censored-text">1A4t17119q</span>, featuring metallic tubes and veins through which poison flows <span class="censored-text">y19x18 py1A1Ar.</span> Toxic saliva constantly drips from his mouth and claws under normal conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His limbs and posture are characterized by long, thick arms equipped with sharp metallic claws capable of cutting even diamond; his joints are reinforced and covered with segmented plates. His legs are powerful and designed for bestial jumps. Although he walks on two legs by default, he can switch to quadrupedal mode to reach maximum speed, adopting a wild posture similar to that of a mutated wolf when running on all fours, leaving corroded footprints from dripping venom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among his special features is a large and heavy shark tail, completely <span class="censored-text">1A4t17119q</span> of flesh, which can be used as a blunt whip or to maintain balance during jumps. Some areas of his body show exposed veins where bright neon green fluid (his nuclear venom) flows, pulsing with each movement. A toxic core, located in the chest inside his body, functions as his heart and generator of venom and toxins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other notable details include his extremely intimidating presence, with a dark and heavy aura, generating discomfort or fear, as if his toxicity could be felt in the air. When moving, he emits metallic creaks, digital buzzes, and venomous drips; his breathing is deep and distorted, resembling that of a mechanical beast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to statistical data, the entity has a height of 3.65 meters and a total weight of 1400 kilograms. It is hypothesized that the high body weight is attributed to the mechanization of his body or the presence of heavy metallic components integrated into various parts of it.
