        <h2>1. Security and Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This <strong>Security and Privacy Policy</strong> sets out the terms under which <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> (a non-profit web project of narrative and creative community nature within the Furry Fandom) collects, uses, protects and manages information from users who visit or interact with the website hosted on Netlify.</p>
        <p><strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> is not a formal business entity; it is a community web project focused on the narrative and creative development of fictional content.</p>
        <p>Use of the website implies express acceptance of this policy. If you do not agree with any of its terms, you are advised to refrain from using the services or forms available.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong><u>2.1. Google Forms</u></strong></p>
        <p>UPEA Corporation uses Google Forms as the only means for users to submit information. These forms are intended for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Registration of <strong>ZAE Entities</strong>.</li>
            <li>Registration of <strong>Employees</strong>.</li>
            <li>Submission of <strong>Feedback</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The forms collect only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact email address.</li>
            <li>Registration information related to the entity or character (fictional content).</li>
            <li>Comments or suggestions about the UPEA Corporation project and website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The email address is used solely for communication purposes related to the registration and management of entities or employees within the project. Any real personal information (such as real names, addresses, photographs of real people or identifiable data) <strong>will be deleted immediately</strong>, and the user will be notified to redo their registration using only fictional information.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> The forms are processed and stored under Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" class="main-link">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" class="main-link">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

        <p><strong><u>2.2. Information Automatically Collected by Netlify</u></strong></p>
        <p>The website is hosted on the Netlify platform, which automatically collects certain basic technical information from visitors, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Visitor IP address.</li>
                <li>Browser type and version.</li>
                <li>Operating system and device used.</li>
                <li>Date and time of access.</li>
                <li>Pages or resources requested (navigation through the website).</li>
                <li>Server response status.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This information is stored in <strong>temporary logs</strong> for approximately 30 days and is used exclusively for:
            <ul>
                <li>Security and attack mitigation.</li>
                <li>Site performance diagnostics.</li>
                <li>Anonymous traffic statistics.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>UPEA Corporation has no direct access to these individual data</strong>, and Netlify handles them in accordance with its own privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p><strong><u>3.1. Narrative Project Management:</u></strong> To publish and maintain the fictional records of ZAE Entities and Employees, according to the content provided by users.</p>
        <p><strong><u>3.2. Communication:</u></strong> The email collected in the forms is used solely to contact the user regarding their registration or narrative contributions.</p>
        <p><strong><u>3.3. Control and Moderation:</u></strong> Minimal information is kept to verify requests for modification or deletion of records. If real personal information is detected, <strong>UPEA Corporation will delete the record immediately and notify the user via the provided email address</strong>. Records are retained only as long as necessary for the narrative or technical purposes of the project. No personal information will be stored beyond the time strictly necessary for its deletion.</p>

        <h2>4. Specifications on Employee Registration and Feedback</h2>
        <p><strong>Employee</strong> records are an integral part of the <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> narrative universe. These files are not deleted; instead, they are <strong>encoded and redacted</strong> through a system called <strong>"Codex Zeta"</strong>, which applies four layers of encoding.</p>
        <p>Only the project owner and authorized personnel have access to this Codex, which:
            <ul>
                <li>Is kept <strong>outside any online platform</strong>.</li>
                <li>Is stored <strong>locally</strong> on authorized personnel devices.</li>
                <li>Contains only encoded textual information and employee images with faces <strong>censored or redacted</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This system ensures the preservation of narrative lore without compromising user privacy. If a user wishes to restore their original registration, they may request it and it will be restored to the state prior to its encoding.</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback</strong> records are stored privately and used exclusively to improve the user and project experience. No personally identifiable information is collected, nor is it used for commercial purposes.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p><strong>UPEA Corporation has no internal account registration system or proprietary databases</strong>. All information is managed exclusively through <strong>Google Forms</strong>, thus reducing the risk of exposure or misuse of personal data. Any personally identifiable information or images of real people will be <strong>deleted immediately</strong> upon detection.</p>
        <p><strong>UPEA Corporation does not sell, rent or disclose personal information to third parties, except in the following cases:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> When required by law or by court order.</li>
                <li><strong>External Service Providers:</strong> Such as Netlify (web hosting) and Google Forms (form management), who act on behalf of the project and are subject to their own privacy policies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Both services may process data on servers located <strong>outside the European Economic Area</strong>, complying with the <strong>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses</strong> that ensure an adequate level of protection under the <strong>GDPR</strong>.</p>

        <h2>6. External Links</h2>
        <p>The website may contain links to external pages not operated by UPEA Corporation. No responsibility is assumed for the content, policies or privacy practices of such sites. We recommend always reviewing the privacy policy of each page before providing personal information.</p>

        <h2>7. Narrative and Collaborative Activities</h2>
        <p>In the future, UPEA Corporation may carry out interactive activities with users (such as roleplay sessions or narrative events) in order to expand the fictional universe of the project. These activities will be voluntary and will be part of the creative development of the project's official story. Under no circumstances will real personal data be requested to participate in them.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to the Security and Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>UPEA Corporation reserves the right to modify or update this Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this same page, indicating <strong>the date of the last update</strong>. Users are responsible for periodically reviewing this section to stay informed of any changes.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact</h2>
        <p>For inquiries, clarifications or requests related to this <strong>Security and Privacy Policy</strong>, you may contact the project team through the <strong>official email or social media</strong> available on the website.</p>
        <p>For reasons of internal confidentiality and security, <strong>UPEA Corporation reserves the right not to disclose the names of personnel</strong> who respond to official communications.</p>
