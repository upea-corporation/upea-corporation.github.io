        <h2>UPEA Corp. Security and Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At UPEA Corp., we are committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your personal data. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide to us or that we collect through your use of our website.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We do not directly collect personally identifiable information through forms on this website. Information that may be collected anonymously includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browsing data:</strong> Information about how you interact with our website (pages visited, time spent, browser type, operating system), collected through Netlify analytics tools (as mentioned in our Cookie Policy) or standard web analytics tools. This data is anonymous and is used to improve the functionality and performance of the site.</li>
            <li><strong>IP address:</strong> IP addresses may be logged by Netlify servers for security and network performance purposes, but they are not directly linked to your identity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For all our online forms (such as Zoomorphic Anthropoid Entities - ZAE registration, Employee registration, Feedback, etc.), we use <strong>Google Forms</strong>, a third-party service provider. Through these forms, we collect the following information that you voluntarily provide to us:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Form-specific information:</strong> Details specific to the form you are filling out (e.g., entity name, entity type, employee data, comments, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>User contact information:</strong> The email address is a mandatory field in all our forms. This is necessary for us to communicate with you regarding your registration or inquiry, and it will not be used to sell user data or for marketing.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This information is managed by Google Forms in accordance with their own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" class="main-link">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" class="main-link">Terms of Service</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>2. How We Use the Information</h3>
        <p>The information collected is used exclusively for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining and improving the functionality and performance of our website.</li>
            <li>Analyzing web traffic in an aggregated and anonymous manner to better understand our visitors' preferences.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the security of our website and preventing fraudulent or malicious activities.</li>
            <li>Contact information is used to communicate with the user who has registered their ZAE entity or submitted their employee file, minimizing the information possible for communication between the UPEA Corporation team and the user, except when required by law.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to keep registration data for verification of the applicant in case of rectification, modification, or deletion of their registration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Registrations and forms will be kept only as long as they are necessary for the narrative or technical purposes of the project. Under no circumstances will real personal data be kept beyond the time necessary for its immediate deletion.</p>

        <h3>3. Specifically for Employee Registration</h3>
        <p>Since employee registration is part of an Alternate Reality Game (ARG), the employee file, including the interview, will serve as a review to determine if they are suitable for the department they wish to join. A copy of the interview and the file will be stored in the UPEA Corporation database during their stay in the narrative universe. If the user decides to leave the UPEA Corporation universe, their registration will not be deleted, but the entire file published on the website, as well as the copy in our database, will be redacted using a <strong>Codex Exclusivo</strong> system. The user has the right to request rectification of their information, but not the complete deletion of the registration, due to the narrative integrity of the ARG.</p>

        <h3>4. Sharing Information</h3>
        <p>UPEA Corp. does not sell, rent, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When required by law or in response to a valid legal process (e.g., a court order).</li>
            <li>To third-party service providers (such as Netlify for web hosting and <strong>Google Forms for form management</strong>) acting on our behalf and contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. Please note that Google will process and store this information on its servers in accordance with its Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>UPEA Corporation uses third-party services (Netlify and Google Forms) that may host data on servers located outside the European Economic Area. Such services are subject to the <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission</strong>, ensuring an adequate level of protection in accordance with the GDPR.</p>

        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>UPEA Corporation applies technical and organizational measures to protect the information stored in its systems, preventing unauthorized access, alteration, or loss of content.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, <strong>UPEA Corporation does not collect or process personally identifiable information</strong>. If a user accidentally enters real personal data (such as full name, address, personal email, recognizable image, or any other sensitive data), <strong>it will be deleted immediately</strong> and the registration will be invalidated.</p>
        <p>The user may redo their registration using only fictional or narrative information, in accordance with the creative purpose of the project.</p>
        <p><strong>UPEA Corporation will not retain real personal information under any circumstances</strong>, except for explicit legal requirement by a competent authority.</p>

        <h3>6. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>In relation to personal data collected through our forms (managed by Google Forms), you have the right to access, rectify, or request the deletion of your information (with the narrative exceptions mentioned for employee registration). To exercise these rights, you can contact us directly at <u>upea.corp@hotmail.com</u>. We are committed to facilitating the exercise of your rights.</p>

        <h3>7. Links to Other Websites</h3>
        <p>Our site may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. We have no control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of third-party sites and assume no responsibility for them. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>

        <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update our Security and Privacy Policy occasionally. We will post any changes on this page, and the "last updated" date at the top of the policy will reflect the effective date of the changes.</p>

        <h3>9. Questions and Contact</h3>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or need clarification about this Security and Privacy Policy, you can contact our team. We are available to resolve your questions through the official contact email or through any of the social networks available in the footer.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, for internal privacy and personnel security reasons, UPEA Corp. reserves the right not to disclose the names of the people who respond to email communications on behalf of the corporation.</p>
