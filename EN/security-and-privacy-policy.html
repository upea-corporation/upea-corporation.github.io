        <h2>UPEA Corp. Security and Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At UPEA Corp., we are committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your personal data. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide to us or that we collect through your use of our website.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We do not directly collect personally identifiable information through forms on this website. Information that may be collected anonymously includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Navigation Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with our website (pages visited, time spent, browser type, operating system), collected through Netlify's analytics tools (as mentioned in our Cookie Policy) or standard web analytics tools. This data is anonymous and is used to improve the site's functionality and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> IP addresses may be logged by Netlify servers for network security and performance purposes, but are not directly linked to your identity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For all our online forms (such as Zoomorphic Anthropoid Entities - ZAE registration, Employee registration, Feedback, etc.), we use <strong>Google Forms</strong>, a third-party service provider. Through these forms, we collect the following information that you voluntarily provide:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Form-Specific Information:</strong> Details specific to the form you are filling out (e.g., entity name, entity type, employee data, comments, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>User Contact Information:</strong> Email address is a mandatory field in all our forms. This is necessary to communicate with you regarding your registration or inquiry, and will not be used for user data sales or marketing.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This information is managed by Google Forms in accordance with their own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" class="main-link">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" class="main-link">Terms of Service</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>2. How We Use the Information</h3>
        <p>The collected information is used exclusively for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining and improving our website's functionality and performance.</li>
            <li>Analyzing web traffic in an aggregated and anonymous way to better understand our visitors' preferences.</li>
            <li>Ensuring our website's security and preventing fraudulent or malicious activities.</li>
            <li>Contact information is used to communicate with users who have registered their ZAE entity or submitted their employee file, minimizing information for communication between the UPEA Corporation team and the user, except when required by law.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to keep registration data for applicant verification in case of rectification, modification, or deletion of their registration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Specifically for Employee Registration</h3>
        <p>Since employee registration is part of an Alternate Reality Game (ARG), the employee file, including the interview, will serve as a review of suitability for the department they wish to join. A copy of the interview and file will be stored in UPEA Corporation's database during their stay in the narrative universe. If the user decides to leave the UPEA Corporation universe, their registration will not be deleted, but all files published on the website, as well as the copy in our database, will be redacted using an <strong>Exclusive Codex</strong> system. The user has the right to request rectification of their information, but not complete deletion of the registration, due to the narrative integrity of the ARG.</p>

        <h3>4. Information Sharing</h3>
        <p>UPEA Corp. does not sell, rent, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When required by law or in response to a valid legal process (for example, a court order).</li>
            <li>To third-party service providers (such as Netlify for web hosting and <strong>Google Forms for form management</strong>) who act on our behalf and are contractually obligated to maintain data confidentiality and security. Please note that Google will process and store this information on their servers in accordance with their Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no Internet data transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

        <h3>6. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>Regarding personal data collected through our forms (managed by Google Forms), you have the right to access, rectify, or request deletion of your information (with the narrative exceptions mentioned for employee registration). To exercise these rights, you can contact us directly at <u>upea.corp@hotmail.com</u>. We are committed to facilitating the exercise of your rights.</p>

        <h3>7. Links to Other Websites</h3>
        <p>Our site may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. We have no control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of third-party sites and assume no responsibility for them. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>

        <h3>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may occasionally update our Security and Privacy Policy. We will post any changes on this page, and the "last updated" date at the top of the policy will reflect the effective date of the changes.</p>

        <h3>9. Questions and Contact</h3>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or need clarification about this Security and Privacy Policy, you can contact our team. We are available to address your concerns through the official contact email or through any of the social media channels available in the footer.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, for internal privacy and staff security reasons, UPEA Corp. reserves the right not to disclose the names of individuals who respond to email communications on behalf of the corporation.</p>
