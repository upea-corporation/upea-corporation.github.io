            <div class="transcript-container">
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Good morning, ZAE#201. Thank you for agreeing to this conversation.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Good morning.</p>
               
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To begin with, how would you define yourself or your species in terms of your fundamental composition, beyond what our sensors can directly detect?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Haha, I don't even know! I'm a fluffy protogen, with insulation in the neck. I don't have as many metal plates as most protogens. They might even be ice plates!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Interesting. What is the mechanism or intrinsic law that governs the manifestation of your singular abilities? Are they conscious, reactive, or a constant function of your existence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I can manifest almost all my abilities at will, except for two very dear abilities. My wings will always show, and they're like frozen crystal, strong but fragile. My other ability is being able to cool the surroundings just by "existing". Hey, it's a good way to combat summer heat, haha!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> I understand. Could you describe your point of origin or the process by which you came to exist in this reality or dimension? Was it a singular event or part of a continuous cycle?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I don't... remember. The first thing I remember was an igloo. In snowy lands. That's where I tested everything I could do with my abilities. I made myself a house better than an igloo! Obviously, made of ice and snow. But going back to the question, I simply appeared one day, with this crown I have. Maybe the crown created me? I don't know, but that sounds extremely cool.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How does your perception of time relate to ours? Do you experience it linearly, simultaneously, or in an altered flow that you can describe?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Uh... what do you mean? How time passes or how I react to it? I wouldn't know how to answer that question... Time passes normally, but a bit cooler than the rest, I guess.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Understood. What is the nature of your consciousness? Is it an individual consciousness, part of a hive mind, or an echo of a greater entity?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Ooooh, how do I behave? I'm very silly, some are even scared by how silly I am. And I behave as I want, ignoring laws. Let them put me in prison, they'll never get me to change!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to perception and communication, how do you process sensory information from our environment? Is there any form of energy or signal that is clearer or more difficult for you to interpret?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> *No response, but Glacien tilts their head slightly* No? Not that I know of. I also don't know how you perceive energy. Generally, I make cold energy that others can feel.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is the most effective way we can communicate with you to minimize misunderstandings and ensure accurate information transmission?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Well, do it as you would want others to communicate with you.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How do you interpret our expressions of language, both verbal and non-verbal? Are there gestures or tones that are inherently clear or confusing to you?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Mainly it's insults and lack of respect that bother me the most. So as long as you're good people, I'll keep being as funny as always!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If you could choose the ideal method of interaction, what would it be? Does it require specific conditions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> *No response*</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of knowledge do you have about the human species, our technology, and our society, and how did you acquire that knowledge?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I was able to study humanity through the internet, searching for human history, cultures, and more. My computer was mainly made of ice, that helped with overheating, and it always ran at full performance!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to your intentions and behavior, do you harbor any intention to cause physical or cognitive harm to members of the human species, or to UPEA Corp.'s infrastructure? Please answer with maximum sincerity.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Why would I want to cause harm?! I just want to have the best time possible. ...besides, I know you'll be able to offer me a home. Since I'm not able to live in a civilized human or anthropomorphic environment. I make cold wherever I go, and I'm tired of looking for a place to live... Hey, I'm not saying my ability is bad, many appreciate the coolness!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> In the past, have you interacted with other species or civilizations? If so, what was the outcome of those interactions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I've kept hidden. And I've barely interacted with other species. The few I've interacted with, some have appreciated my coolness, while others haven't. Some humans tried to attack me, and I just defended myself. A couple were impaled by compact ice spears I created using my abilities, while the rest were frozen to death. I just defended myself. *Glacien's visor always showed a smile while speaking, and their tone sounded calm, knowing what they had done, without remorse.*</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any action or circumstance that, for you, is a provocation or generates an undesired response from us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Lack of respect is enough to bother me a lot, whether it's towards me or others.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of control do you exercise over your singular abilities? Can they activate or manifest involuntarily or accidentally?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I answered this earlier, but mainly the abilities that affect others, like ice spears or calming snow. However, I can't control cooling the environment, and it's mainly tied to how I feel. Slight coolness means I'm happy, while constant piercing cold means something's wrong with me. Hey, I'm rarely not happy, I'm always joking to keep myself happy!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your main motivation or drive? Do you seek knowledge, survival, an unknown purpose, or something else?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I'm looking for a quiet place to live, in a place that can contain my abilities and desires. Few are willing to live with me, since I induce constant coolness.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Would you be willing to cooperate with UPEA Corp. in a controlled study environment, with the goal of achieving mutual understanding and safe coexistence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Of course! I believe in mutual coexistence between humans and anthropomorphics! Although I'm also useful on a battlefield, so if you need to relieve your troops on a battlefield, count on me!</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What expectations do you have from this interaction with UPEA Corp.? Is there anything you hope to obtain from us or from this relationship?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I've said it before, I hope for a peaceful life, in a place that can contain my abilities.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to restrictions and limitations, are there natural limits or restrictions to your abilities or your way of being? Anything you can't do or that affects you negatively?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Not really. I create my own environment as I go. I like the coolness that I simply produce.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Are you susceptible to any type of external influence (physical, psychic, energetic) or are you immune to the forces known to us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> Although I said I'm useful in a combat situation, my capabilities say otherwise. I'm not stronger or more resistant than the average operator, but that doesn't mean I'm trash! I'm capable of turning the tides of combat in my favor! But I'm not strong on my own.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your perception of confinement or a controlled environment? Does this affect your state or capabilities in any way?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I've always wondered what it would be like to be confined in a controlled place. These are the kind of silly questions I always ask myself. But I see that I can be accepted in this place, even if I'm a portable freezer.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there anything in your current environment or in our study methods that you find uncomfortable, painful, or harmful?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> No, not that I know of. But if something seems outrageous to me, I'll communicate it. Communication is the first step for good coexistence.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Finally, what fundamental value do you consider your existence could bring to our understanding of the universe or reality itself?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I could freeze entire volcanoes, or cool down hell, if someone can take me there. I can cool many places or even show you what snowflakes or ice values are like. Hehe.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any crucial question we haven't asked that you consider essential to understanding your nature?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> *No response.*</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If long-term coexistence were possible, what would be, in your opinion, the ideal conditions to maintain a balance between our two existences?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> I am someone special. I don't think complete coexistence with humans and me is possible. But, the best conditions would be in a place where it's very hot. Cooling places is my favorite pastime.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To conclude this session, is there anything you wish to communicate to us specifically at this moment?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#201] ></strong> ...who is that fire-colored entity? The one watching us from the other side- They've disappeared... was it a hallucination? They seem to be someone important to this place, I'd like to "break the ice" with them.</p>
            
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong>Critical anomalies have been detected during the final phase of audio transcription and security camera recording in the interview room. The data corresponding to these records are corrupted or damaged.</p>

                <h3>INTERVIEWER'S CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>The entity ZAE#201, also known as Glacien, describes itself as a "fluffy protogen" with ice characteristics, including frozen crystal wings and the innate ability to cool its surroundings by mere presence. Its origin is unknown to itself, only remembering appearing in snowy lands with a crown. Its perception of time is linear, similar to human perception, though with a constant sensation of coolness. Its consciousness is individual and describes itself as "silly," acting according to its will and ignoring laws if desired.</p>
                <p>Regarding its abilities, it can manifest almost all of them at will, with the exception of its wings and environmental cooling capacity, which are constant. It has interacted with humans in the past, defending itself lethally when attacked, showing no remorse. Its knowledge of humanity was acquired through the internet. Its main motivation is to find a quiet place to live that can contain its abilities, as its constant emission of cold makes coexistence with other species difficult.</p>
                <p>ZAE#201-G expresses a clear willingness to cooperate with UPEA Corp. in a controlled study environment, provided it is given a suitable home. Although it considers itself useful in combat for relieving troops with cold, it acknowledges that its physical resistance is not superior to that of an average operator. It is susceptible to disrespect as provocation. The entity perceives no discomfort or pain in its current environment and is open to communicating any future problems.</p>
                <p>Considering the information obtained, ZAE#201 is classified as a <strong>Delta Class (Δ)</strong> entity. While it possesses capabilities that can be lethal and has demonstrated a carefree use of them in the past, its main motivation is the search for a place to live peacefully. Its willingness to cooperate and ability to communicate its needs suggest that, with appropriate containment and housing protocols, the risk it presents is moderate and manageable. The main challenge lies in finding an environment that adapts to its constant cooling ability without negatively affecting UPEA Corp.'s personnel or infrastructure, as well as monitoring its responses to possible provocations related to respect. Its final mention of a "fire-colored entity" suggests that entity ZAE#666 was present at the end of the interview, as systems failed shortly after. It is possible that entity ZAE#666-HT has an interest in ZAE#201.</p>
