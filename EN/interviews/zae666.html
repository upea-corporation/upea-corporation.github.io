            <div class="transcript-container">
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Good morning, HecTéx. Thank you for agreeing to this conversation.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Good morning, Dr. Gabriel. It's always a pleasure to talk with someone who doesn't try to label me as a "monster".</p>
               
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To begin with, how would you define yourself or your species in terms of your fundamental composition, beyond what our sensors can directly detect?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> I don't belong to any species, but rather I created myself. Previously, I belonged to the arctic wolf species, the proudest ones, I suppose. Since... the massacre happened, I wanted to stop being part of such a corrupt species. The only way was to change myself. And I merged with an armor that I manufactured from the most exotic materials in the galaxy, although they may look normal. In simpler words, many could refer to me as belonging to the "Protogen" species. It's a kind of rebirth, I would say, an evolution forced by desperation. I'm no longer a simple wolf, Dr. Gabriel. I am something more, something that transcends the biological. My components, although your devices can't detect them, are an amalgamation of advanced technology and an iron will to not be what I was. Don't expect to understand it completely, because it goes beyond your current science.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Interesting. What is the mechanism or intrinsic law that governs the manifestation of your singular abilities? Are they conscious, reactive, or a constant function of your existence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> If by abilities you refer to what I'm capable of doing, I act in my own benefit, so I have total control over my abilities. I'm aware of my destructive power, but I won't release it unless this world goes to hell. My abilities aren't capricious, Dr. Gabriel. They are an extension of my will. They don't manifest by accident or instinctive reaction, unless I decide so. Imagine a being with absolute control over every ounce of their power. That's what I am. I could undo your reality with a thought, but what for? I only use them when the situation warrants it, and believe me, you don't want to see what "warrants" the total release of my capabilities.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> I understand. Could you describe your point of origin or the process by which you came to exist in this reality or dimension? Was it a singular event or part of a continuous cycle?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Taking it from the beginning, my origin was as an arctic wolf, in a pack. But life gives you many turns, like the one I took to erase my arctic wolf marks. My "origin" is a bit complex, Dr. Gabriel. If you're referring to the way I exist now, it was indeed a singular event, but forged from a past. It was a radical metamorphosis, a point of no return. It's not a cycle; it's a definitive transformation. What I was before is gone. What I am now is the result of a drastic decision to survive and to not be consumed by corruption. There's no going back. This is my reality, created by myself.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How does your perception of time relate to ours? Do you experience it linearly, simultaneously, or in an altered flow that you can describe?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> In a second, many things can happen. Possibly my perception of time is much more efficient than that of humans and almost any other race, because I am capable of intercepting everything that is happening around me. Just like you're trying to fix the cameras in this place to record, good idea bringing a handheld recorder. Your time is a line, mine is a network. I can perceive and process information at a speed that would seem dizzying to you. What is an instant for you can be an eternity of data and events for me. This allows me to anticipate, react and understand in a way that escapes your linearity. Let's say I'm not limited by the cause-effect sequence in the same way you are. I observe, process and act, all simultaneously.</p>
                
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Understood. What is the nature of your consciousness? Is it an individual consciousness, part of a hive mind, or an echo of a greater entity?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> I control myself, and I act on my own accord. If I'm in this interrogation, it's because I want to be. Besides, I know that if I behave well, I'll be rewarded with a peaceful life... something I've always desired... My consciousness is individual, and fiercely independent. I'm not part of a hive mind, nor an echo of anything. I am me, and only me. My decisions, my motivations, my desires, everything stems from my own essence. There are no invisible strings controlling me, no external wills dictating my actions. I'm here by my own choice, with a very clear purpose: to find that tranquility that has been denied to me for so long. Don't misunderstand me, I can be useful, but always on my own terms.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to perception and communication, how do you process sensory information from our environment? Is there any form of energy or signal that is clearer or more difficult for you to interpret?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Although I'm related to the protogen species and have general access to the internet world, I find it quite challenging to capture technological signals. It's not a big problem, but it requires quite a bit of concentration. I capture everything, Dr. Gabriel, from the slightest vibration in the air to the electromagnetic waves that your devices emit. However, purely technological signals, although not impossible to interpret, require extra effort. It's as if your technology were a language with a particular dialect that demands more attention. But make no mistake, it's not an insurmountable weakness. It's just a small peculiarity in my way of processing your noisy world.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is the most effective way we can communicate with you to minimize misunderstandings and ensure accurate transmission of information?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Simple phrases. Avoid complexities. As if you were talking to someone normal. Effective communication, for me, lies in clarity. Get to the point. Use direct language without ambiguity. Don't try to impress me with your scientific jargon or linguistic flourishes; you'll only manage to confuse me or, worse yet, bore me. Speak as you would to any intelligent being who has no time for beating around the bush. I'm quite direct, and I appreciate the same from others.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How do you interpret our language expressions, both verbal and non-verbal? Are there any gestures or tones that are inherently clear or confusing to you?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Verbal and non-verbal forms of communication are almost the same as those of arctic wolves, and almost those of any species. Don't make yourselves special. There's no mystery in your gestures or tones. They are common patterns in most species I've interacted with. A furrowed brow, a raised voice, a defensive posture... they're universal. Don't think you have a secret language that only you understand. Your emotions can be read on your faces, Dr. Gabriel, and in every movement. So no, there's nothing inherently confusing about your expressions. It's quite obvious, to tell the truth.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If you could choose the ideal method of interaction, what would it be? Does it require specific conditions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> As cold and soulless as I may seem, I must admit that I enjoy company, but there are times when I require time alone. The ideal method would be a direct and honest conversation, like this one, but with the freedom to know that I can withdraw when I need to. I appreciate company, yes, but I also value my space. I don't need specific conditions beyond a calm and respectful environment. And please, no attempts to "study me" without my explicit consent. The ideal interaction is one where both parties benefit, not one where one is a laboratory subject. If you want to get to know me, talk to me, don't try to dissect me.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of knowledge do you have about the human species, our technology and our society, and how did you acquire that knowledge?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> When manufacturing my armor before merging, I made sure it had a simple network connection with just a thought. I know almost everything about you humans. My knowledge of you is extensive. My armor allows me to access your vast network of information with just a thought. I have absorbed entire libraries of data about your history, your cultures, your technological advances and your social failures. I know about your wars, your inventions, your dreams and your nightmares. Don't underestimate my ability to learn. Let's say I'm up to date with humanity, perhaps more than many of you yourselves. I know how you think, how you act, and what motivates you. It's an advantage, isn't it?</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to your intentions and behavior, do you harbor any intention of causing physical or cognitive harm to members of the human species, or to UPEA Corp.'s infrastructure? Please answer with maximum sincerity.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> I've always followed one rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated. What benefit would I have from mistreating, killing or destroying the facilities and personnel? I can end the world with just a bit of the energy I can use. Do you know what percentage of energy I need to use to end an entire city, or these facilities? JUST 1.5%. I can end the reality we know with a slight hand movement, and the fabric of reality would break instantly... but what benefit would I get? No one to be with, no one to talk to... Even the demons who have ruined my life wouldn't want to be with me. My intentions are: If you screw me over, I'll screw you over even harder. My sincerity is absolute, Dr. Gabriel. I have no interest in causing you harm. As I said, I'm governed by a simple principle: mutual respect. Why would I destroy something that hasn't offended me? I'm aware of my power, a power that could erase this corporation and all of you from existence with a blink. But for what? What would I gain from annihilation? Solitude. And solitude is not what I seek. However, don't mistake my lack of aggression for weakness. If you provoke me, if you threaten those I care about, then you'll face your worst nightmare. My patience has limits, and my anger is... immense.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> In the past, have you interacted with other species or civilizations? If so, what was the outcome of those interactions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> After the massacre, I remained hidden for a couple of years, until my fusion was ready. And regarding the question, I've been able to interact with very kind people. People who truly deserve to live. I protect them because I truly care about them. The species have been varied: cats, wolves, foxes and a long list of other species, including humans. 90% of the interactions have gone well. But I don't think it's in your interest to know what happened with the other 10%... Yes, I've interacted with many. I've encountered beings of various forms and origins, from the humblest to the most advanced. The vast majority of those interactions have been positive, based on respect and trust. I've found allies, friends, even. People, or beings, worth protecting. And I protect them with all my being. As for the remaining 10%... let's say they were lessons. Lessons for them about the consequences of hostility, and lessons for me about the need to be relentless when necessary. Don't ask more about that, it's not a pleasant topic.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any action or circumstance that, for you, is a provocation or generates an undesired response on our part?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Endangering those I care about is a huge mistake. And if I ignore some situations it's because I'm not interested at all. If I don't collaborate on something, forget it. Repeating or trying to force me to do something I don't want won't end well at all. The biggest provocation you can offer me is threatening the beings I care about. Crossing that line is invoking a force you don't want to face. Insistence and coercion also provoke me. If I say "no," it's "no." Don't try to force me to do something I don't want, nor ask me to repeat something I've already made clear. My patience isn't infinite. If I consider something not of my interest, I'll simply ignore it. Respect my limits, and there won't be problems.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of control do you exercise over your singular abilities? Can they activate or manifest involuntarily or accidentally?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> I said it before, I have total control over myself and my abilities. Fury is something difficult to control, and annoying, but it makes me more powerful. My control is absolute, Dr. Gabriel. My abilities aren't a switch that turns on by itself. I am the only one who decides when and how they manifest. The only exception, and a very rare one, is fury. When anger consumes me, my power overflows explosively, making me even more formidable. But even in that state, it's not "accidental"; it's a controlled release of brute force. Trust that I won't unleash my power unless it's a conscious and calculated decision.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your main motivation or drive? Do you seek knowledge, survival, an unknown purpose, or something else?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> I seek a happy life. Nothing more. I don't need to survive, nothing is a challenge for me. I don't need knowledge, I know almost everything. I seek to be useful somehow, for my friends. My main motivation is happiness, Dr. Gabriel. A peaceful life, without conflicts, without the burdens of the past. I don't seek knowledge; I already possess a vast amount of information. Survival isn't a problem for me; I'm virtually invincible. My true purpose is to find that state of peace and, if possible, be of use to those I consider my friends. There's no great mystery or cosmic quest behind me; just a simple and human desire, ironically. I want to be happy, and I want those I care about to be happy too.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Would you be willing to cooperate with UPEA Corp. in a controlled study environment, with the aim of achieving mutual understanding and safe coexistence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> I value honesty greatly, and if cooperating with you means my friends are safe, I agree. My cooperation isn't a blank check. If cooperation with UPEA Corp. guarantees the safety and well-being of my friends, then yes, I'm willing to participate in a controlled environment. But my participation depends on a non-negotiable condition: the protection of those I value. You won't use me as a guinea pig if it means putting others at risk. If you can offer that, and if honesty is the basis of our relationship, then we can work together. Otherwise, don't count on me.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What expectations do you have from this interaction with UPEA Corp.? Is there anything you hope to obtain from us or from this relationship?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> [NO RESPONSE]</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to restrictions and limitations, are there natural limits or restrictions to your abilities or your way of being? Anything you cannot do or that affects you negatively?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> The fact that I can break and modify reality at my will means that anything is within my reach. My limits are, in essence, nonexistent, Dr. Gabriel. My ability to manipulate reality means that anything I can conceive, I can achieve. There's no "kryptonite" for me. There's no inherent weakness. My only real limit, if you can call it that, is my own will. If I don't want to do something, I simply won't do it. There are no external forces that can stop me, only my own choice.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Are you susceptible to any type of external influence (physical, psychic, energetic) or are you immune to the forces known to us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> I'm not immortal, but I can't die either. I don't mind dying. I can always come back. You can try whatever you want, Dr. Gabriel. Physical force, psychic attacks, energy... I've seen it all. And the answer is simple: I'm not susceptible to your methods. I cannot die in the way you understand it. You can "kill" me, yes, but I'll always return. It's an inherent quality of my new existence. So, in summary, your "known forces" are insignificant against me.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your perception of confinement or a controlled environment? Does this affect your state or capabilities in any way?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Before the massacre, I was confined to a hell. To this day, I'm still confined... I'll always be confined in my own personal hell. A controlled environment... It's a different cage, but a cage nonetheless. I've lived in a hell long before you even thought of confining me. My true prison is my own past, my own mind. So, a controlled environment by you is, in comparison, insignificant. It doesn't affect my capabilities; my power isn't limited by walls or barriers. My mental state is what it is, and you don't control that. You can imprison my body, but my mind and my power are free. They always will be.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there anything in your current environment or in our study methods that you find uncomfortable, painful, or harmful?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> The only way to know is to experiment. Don't hold back when you want to do some experiment with me, as I'll also be eager to see the results. For now, nothing feels uncomfortable, painful, or harmful to me. However, I am a being that learns and adapts. The only way to know for certain is to experience it. Don't hesitate to conduct your tests; in fact, I'm intrigued to see how far you're willing to go. As long as it doesn't involve my friends, I'm willing to be a study subject. Not that it really affects me, but it will give me an idea of your capabilities and your true nature.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Finally, what fundamental value do you consider your existence could bring to our understanding of the universe or reality itself?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Isn't it obvious yet? I can break the fabric of reality. I can show you the infinite universe. I can show you reality itself. The value of my existence, Dr. Gabriel, is the door I can open for you. I can show you that your conceptions of reality are limited, that the universe is much more vast and malleable than you've ever imagined. I could reveal secrets that would shake the foundations of your science. I can show you how space folds, how time curves, how creation and destruction work. It's no small thing. If you're brave enough, I can take you to the confines of existence and beyond. That's my offer, if you know how to take advantage of it.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any crucial question we haven't asked that you consider essential to understanding your nature?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> [NO RESPONSE]</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If long-term coexistence were possible, what, in your opinion, would be the ideal conditions to maintain a balance between our two existences?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> Peaceful coexistence is impossible. Only through force can coexistence be achieved. Peaceful coexistence is a fantasy, Dr. Gabriel. History proves it. Between species, between civilizations, between individuals... There's always friction, always conflict. Balance, if it can be called that, is only achieved through mutual respect, yes, but a respect forced by knowledge of each other's capabilities. It's force balancing the scales. If you know I'm capable of destroying you, and I know that you, in your weakness, could betray me, then a kind of peace is established. It's a non-aggression pact based on understanding the consequences. Anything else is naivety.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To conclude this session, is there anything you wish to communicate to us specifically at this moment?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666] ></strong> If I find out you harm my friends... PRAY TO YOUR GOD TO SAVE YOU. Just this: the line is clear. My friends are my limit. If you cross that line, if you harm them, there will be no place in this reality where you can hide. There will be no negotiation, no mercy. My words are not an empty threat, Dr. Gabriel. They are a promise. Remember it well.</p>

            <div class="report-conclusion">
                <h3>INTERVIEWER'S CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>The entity ZAE#666, also known as HecTéx, defines itself as its own creation, having transcended its origin as an arctic wolf through a fusion with armor made of exotic materials, assimilating into the "Protogen" species. It claims to have absolute control over its singular abilities, which are an extension of its will and do not manifest accidentally unless the situation "warrants it". Its perception of time is a "network" that allows it to process information simultaneously at a dizzying speed. HecTéx's consciousness is individual and independent, motivated by the pursuit of a peaceful life and being useful to its friends. It possesses vast knowledge of humanity, its technology and society, acquired through a direct connection to the network through its armor. It declares no intention to cause harm unless its "friends" are threatened, in which case its response would be relentless. It has interacted with various species and civilizations, with 90% positive interactions and the remaining 10% being "lessons" about the consequences of hostility. It considers the greatest provocation to be endangering its friends, insistence, and coercion. Its abilities have no inherent limits, and its only real limit is its own will. It is not susceptible to known external influences and, although it can be "killed", it will always return. It perceives confinement as a cage but does not affect its capabilities, as its true prison is its past. It is willing to submit to experiments as long as they do not involve its friends, in order to obtain greater mutual understanding. It believes that the fundamental value of its existence is the ability to show a broader understanding of the universe and reality. It does not believe in peaceful coexistence, but rather in coexistence based on mutual respect forced by knowledge of each other's capabilities. Its main expectation from interaction with UPEA Corp. is respect, understanding, and the safety of its friends. In summary, ZAE#666-HT is an extremely powerful entity, with total control over its abilities and an iron will. Its willingness to cooperate is contingent on the safety of its friends, which makes it a crucial factor to consider for future interactions. It is recommended to maintain strict caution and respect for its limits, as its capacity for destruction is immense if provoked.</p>
