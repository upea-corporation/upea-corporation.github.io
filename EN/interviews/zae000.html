                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Good morning, ZAE#000. Thank you for agreeing to this conversation.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Good morning. This better be worth it.</p>
               
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To begin with, how would you define yourself or your species in terms of your fundamental composition, beyond what our sensors can directly detect?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> I am what you see: a wolf, yes, but not like the ones you know from your documentaries. I'm more... upright, more thinking, more human in my form, though not in spirit. You label me as 'grey wolf', but those are your categories, not mine. My origin is that of a solitary predator, an alpha by nature, but without the need for a pack to follow me. I belong to no one and nothing. I am an individual force, and that's how I define myself. My 'sensors' don't detect weaknesses, only the vast and often irritating presence of others. What they detect is my form, but not my true composition: an indomitable will and an existence forged in solitude.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Interesting. What is the mechanism or intrinsic law that governs the manifestation of your singular abilities? Are they conscious, reactive, or a constant function of your existence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Abilities? Don't make me laugh. They're not 'abilities' in the sense you understand them. They're extensions of my being, of my will. I am fully conscious of what I can do and, believe me, I control them with absolute precision. They're not reactive; they activate by my decision, and only when I deem it necessary. I won't give you details about how they work, it's none of your business. Besides, you already know, don't you? Your cameras, your surveillance devices... you observe me constantly. I'm not an open book, but you've seen enough to know that what I have, I control. And what I control, I use at my convenience. So don't insist with questions about my 'powers', it's wasted time.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> I understand. Could you describe your point of origin or the process by which you came to exist in this reality or dimension? Was it a singular event or part of a continuous cycle?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> My origin... is pure and raw survival. It wasn't a cycle, nor a divine blessing. It was an escape, a desperate struggle to exist, to escape from a... place you don't need to know about. I arrived in this reality, in this dimension, by my own means, alone, scratching and biting every step of the way. I didn't ask for your 'help', nor your 'hospitality'. I was living my life in peace, my own peace, until your chains and this damned collar dragged me here. And let me be clear: if you don't remove this abomination from my neck and return what's mine, I swear by every atom of my being that there won't be a corner on this planet where you can hide. I will hunt each one of you, one by one. This is not a singular event; it's a constant in my existence: freedom is my only law.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How does your perception of time relate to ours? Do you experience it linearly, simultaneously, or in an altered flow that you can describe?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Time... what is there to say about time? I experience it the same way you do, linearly. There are no great mysteries here. I'm not from another dimension nor do I have strange temporal abilities. I was born and grew up on this planet, under the same sun and moon as you. A second is a second, a minute is a minute. It doesn't affect me in any special way, nor do I perceive it in an altered form. I am a being of this earth, and time flows for me like for any other creature here. It's one of the few things we share without any complication.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Understood. What is the nature of your consciousness? Is it an individual consciousness, part of a hive mind, or an echo of a greater entity?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Hahaha... Are you seriously asking me that? How stupid! Do you think I'm some kind of hive mind or a puppet of a superior entity? Of course not! My consciousness is as individual as yours, and much stronger, I assure you. Every thought, every decision, every impulse is mine and mine alone. There are no invisible strings controlling me, no voices dictating to me. I am the master of my own being. I'm not an 'alien' in the sense that my mind is connected to some galactic network. I am a being with my own will, and I don't seek to be part of something bigger. I'm already big enough by myself.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to perception and communication, how do you process sensory information from our environment? Is there any form of energy or signal that is clearer or more difficult for you to interpret?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> It's difficult to explain to you. My senses are... different. It's not that I interpret things radically differently, but my sensory acuity is at a level you can barely conceive. I don't see ghosts or spirits, it's nothing mystical. It's more like an ability to capture subtle changes in the environment: the slightest crunch in the grass miles away, a change in the air before a storm, the vibration of your intentions. My hearing is exceptional, my sense of smell goes without saying. And yes, I have a kind of 'sixth sense', an intuition that alerts me to dangers or presences. It's an advantage, yes, but it's also incredibly annoying. It's like having a million alarms going off at once, a constant avalanche of information that sometimes I'd rather not perceive.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is the most effective way we can communicate with you to minimize misunderstandings and ensure accurate transmission of information?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> The most effective way to communicate with me is to be direct. Forget the formalities, the titles, the convoluted questions. This isn't a job interview, it's a damn interrogation. So, speak clearly, without beating around the bush. Get to the point. Don't try to be polite or subtle; with a wolf, that's a waste of time. I want information without ornaments, and I'll give my answers the same way. If you start beating around the bush, I'll simply lose interest and you won't get anything from me. I respect frankness, not theater.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How do you interpret our expressions of language, both verbal and non-verbal? Are there gestures or tones that are inherently clear or confusing to you?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> I've said it before: as much as my form is more 'anthropomorphic', my mind works with a logic you understand. Your verbal and non-verbal expressions are... normal. There's nothing extraordinary about them. A growl is a growl in any species, a fake smile is evident. I understand your spoken language perfectly, and voice tones give me a lot of information. If you're scared, I know it. If you're lying, I smell it. As for sign language... no, I have no idea about that. My senses focus on sound and smell, not on coded movements. Common hand signals, the ones anyone would understand, yes, I get those. But if you expect me to read lips or understand sign language for the deaf, forget it. Stick to verbal, it's what works best.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If you could choose the ideal method of interaction, what would it be? Does it require specific conditions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> The ideal method of interaction is simple: don't bother me. My patience is limited, and I get angry easily. If you want me to 'interact' with you, if you need my presence or my 'opinion', then approach with respect, and without fuss. I don't need formal invitations, nor scheduled appointments. Come calmly, as if you were talking to someone normal, not with an exotic caged creature. The key is calm and the absence of... coercion. And, above all, don't try to control me. If you feel the need to bother me with insignificant things, you'll regret it. My conditions are few but firm: no formalities, no irritations, and with the understanding that my patience is a scarce resource.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of knowledge do you have about the human species, our technology and our society, and how did you acquire that knowledge?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> I know humans better than you think, and no, I don't particularly like them. I've observed your species, your constant need for control, your hypocrisy. I know about your societies, your structures, your weak norms. As for your technology, it's... useful. Your little devices, those 'mobile phones' and 'computers', can be entertaining, yes, to kill time. But I'm not a slave to them. I prefer disconnection, the freedom of the natural world, away from your networks and screens. However, I've noticed how you see me, how you see us. Those 'avatars' you call 'Furries'... it's your attempt to domesticate the wild, to turn what you don't understand into something harmless. But don't be mistaken. Still, I recognize that the creativity you demonstrate with those images is a powerful skill, though wasted on fantasy. They've allowed me to understand a bit about your minds, and that's an advantage I don't waste.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to your intentions and behavior, do you harbor any intention of causing physical or cognitive harm to members of the human species, or to UPEA Corp.'s infrastructure? Please answer with maximum sincerity.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> My intention... is survival. And if to survive, I must cause physical or cognitive harm to members of your species, or even dismantle all of UPEA Corp.'s infrastructure, then I will. Without hesitation. I have no attachment to your lives or your buildings. My existence is all that matters to me. Sincerity? Here it is: I highly doubt it will come to that extreme, unless you corner me, unless you force me to defend myself. I'm not a monster that destroys for pleasure. But I am a predator, and if my life is at stake, I will become your worst nightmare. So, don't put me in that situation. Don't give me a reason to show you what I'm capable of. My word is law: there is no harm if there is no existential provocation. But if there is, there will be no mercy.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> In the past, have you interacted with other species or civilizations? If so, what was the outcome of those interactions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> There's nothing you need to know about my past beyond what I've already said. My interactions with other 'species' or 'civilizations' are irrelevant to this... 'interrogation'. What happened, happened. And it's none of your business. All that matters is that I'm here, now, and that my survival is all that moves me. If there were interactions, they were on my own terms and for my benefit. I won't give you a report of my 'adventures'.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any action or circumstance that, for you, is a provocation or generates an undesired response on our part?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Any attempt to control me, to force me to do something I don't want, or to threaten my freedom will be a provocation. I've made that clear already. The cages, the collars... that's a provocation. Your insistence, your 'experiments' without my consent. I am a free being, and anything that threatens that freedom will generate a response you don't want to see. Don't try to play with me. Don't try to domesticate me. Don't try to cage me. Those are the lines you must not cross.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of control do you exercise over your singular abilities? Can they activate or manifest involuntarily or accidentally?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> I've said it before, my control is absolute. There are no 'accidents' with me. Every action, every manifestation of what I'm capable of, is a conscious decision. I'm not an uncontrolled animal. My abilities don't trigger by themselves. The only variable is my will. If I decide to use them, I do. If not, they remain latent. So, no, there are no involuntary manifestations. Just the will of a wolf. Don't underestimate my discipline.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your main motivation or drive? Do you seek knowledge, survival, an unknown purpose, or something else?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> My main motivation is survival, pure and simple. After that, it's living in peace. I don't seek knowledge, I don't need a cosmic purpose. My purpose is to exist on my own terms, without anyone bothering me. I want my freedom, my space, and a quiet life. There are no hidden mysteries here. My drive is that of any wild creature: to survive and thrive without chains. It's the most basic, and the most important thing to me.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Would you be willing to cooperate with UPEA Corp. in a controlled study environment, with the goal of achieving mutual understanding and safe coexistence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Cooperate? That depends on your terms. If 'cooperate' means you'll try to control me, study me like a specimen, or put me in a cage, then no. If your 'mutual understanding' implies my submission, then no either. My cooperation will only be possible if it benefits my survival and freedom. If you leave me alone, if you remove this damn collar and return mine, and if you allow me to follow my own path without interference, then we could talk. Otherwise, there is no 'safe coexistence', only mine.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What expectations do you have from this interaction with UPEA Corp.? Is there anything you hope to obtain from us or from this relationship?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> The only expectation I have is that you leave me alone. That you understand that I'm not a toy, nor an experiment. That you return what's mine and allow me to return to the life I had before you dragged me here. I don't expect a 'relationship' with UPEA Corp., just the cessation of this interference. The only thing I want to obtain from you is my freedom. Nothing more. And if you can't give me that, then there's nothing more to say.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to restrictions and limitations, are there natural limits or restrictions to your abilities or your way of being? Anything you can't do or that affects you negatively?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> My limits... the only limits that exist are those I impose on myself. There are no natural weaknesses. There's no 'kryptonite'. Nothing you know can really affect me permanently. My will is my only restriction. If I decide something can't be done, then it's not done. But there are no external forces that can stop me. I am... resilient. So no, there's nothing I can't do if I set my mind to it, and nothing that affects me negatively in the long term. Your methods are pathetic compared to what I'm capable of enduring.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Are you susceptible to any type of external influence (physical, psychic, energetic) or are you immune to the forces known to us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Your 'known forces'... are insignificant. Physical? Psychic? Energetic? I've endured worse things than you can imagine. I'm not susceptible to your little tricks. You can try everything, but in the end, I'll still be here. The only thing that matters to me is my survival, and for that, I'm more than immune to your weak attempts. There's nothing in your arsenal that can bend my will. I'm above your 'known forces'.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your perception of confinement or a controlled environment? Does this affect your state or your capabilities in any way?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Confinement is a cage. A damn cage, no matter how big it is. I've been through confinement hells before you even dreamed of catching me. This is nothing new. It affects my mental state, yes, because I hate restriction. It irritates me, it enrages me. But it doesn't affect my capabilities. My abilities aren't tied to a physical space. My power isn't reduced by walls or bars. You can cage my body, but my spirit and strength are free. They always will be. And the more you confine me, the more I'll want to get out and show you what true freedom is.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there anything in your current environment or in our study methods that you find uncomfortable, painful, or harmful?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Everything that takes away my freedom is uncomfortable. Any attempt at control, study without my permission, 'experiment' without my benefit, is harmful. The only thing I tolerate is this conversation, for now. I'm not interested in being a study subject for your small minds. If you want to know something about me, ask. Don't try to dissect me. What's truly harmful is your arrogance and your belief that you can dominate everything you don't understand. That's what bothers me more than anything.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Finally, what fundamental value do you consider your existence could contribute to our understanding of the universe or reality itself?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Value? Understanding of the universe? My existence shows you the true strength of will and survival. It shows you that there are things you can't control, nor understand with your simple devices. It shows you that freedom is all that matters. That's the 'value' I offer you. I'm not here to give you lessons in quantum physics or multidimensional existence. I'm here to live, and if that teaches you something about your insignificance or the force of nature, then good for you. If not, it's your problem.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any crucial question we haven't asked that you consider essential to understanding your nature?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> No. You've asked enough stupid questions. I think you already have a clear idea of who I am and what I want. What's essential to understanding my nature is simply to leave me alone and let me be. You don't need more 'crucial questions'. You need to listen to what I've already told you.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If long-term coexistence were possible, what would be, in your opinion, the ideal conditions to maintain a balance between our two existences?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Coexistence. A funny word. There is no 'ideal' coexistence with you. There's only a truce, an understanding that if you leave me alone, I won't bother you. The conditions would be: zero interference, absolute freedom for me, and the removal of this collar. If you respect me as a free being, and not as an experiment, then we could 'coexist'. Otherwise, there is no possible balance. Only struggle. Choose wisely.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To conclude this session, is there anything you wish to communicate to us specifically at this time?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#000] ></strong> Remove this collar. And give me back my collar. That's all you need to know. And if you decide not to do it... your fate will be sealed by my own claws. It's not a threat. It's a promise.</p>

            <div class="report-conclusion">
                <h3>INTERVIEWER'S CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>Entity ZAE#000 describes itself as a male wolf, more anthropomorphic than animal, belonging to the 'grey wolf' species, although it prefers to operate alone and can assume an alpha role if desired. It claims to have total control over its abilities, which are conscious, but refuses to disclose details about them, suggesting that UPEA already knows them through surveillance. Its origin traces back to a survival and escape event from an unspecified 'place', arriving at this reality by its own means. It severely warns that if the confinement collar is not removed and its own collar returned, it will dedicate itself to hunting UPEA Corp. members. Its perception of time is linear and similar to human, as it is a being of this planet. Its consciousness is individual, rejecting the notion of being part of a hive mind or a greater entity.</p>
                <p>Regarding perception, it can capture sensory information beyond what humans can, including superior hearing and an acute 'sixth sense', although it finds it annoying. The most effective way to communicate with it is directly and without formalities, as it considers the interaction an interrogation. It interprets human verbal and non-verbal expressions normally, with the exception that it doesn't understand sign language, only common hand signals. The ideal method of interaction is not to bother it excessively, and if its presence is required, to approach calmly and without formalities, as it angers easily. It possesses considerable knowledge about humanity, its technology and society, although it doesn't like humans. It considers technology useful for entertainment (mobile phones, computers), but prefers to stay disconnected. It recognizes human creativity in the creation of 'Furry avatars'.</p>
                <p>Regarding its intentions, it declares that it would cause physical or cognitive harm to humans or UPEA Corp.'s infrastructure only if necessary for its own survival, although it doubts it would come to that point unless cornered. Its control over its abilities is total and they don't activate involuntarily. Its main motivation is survival and living peacefully, without interference. Strict caution and compliance with its demands about the collar are recommended, as its reaction capacity and disposition to violence are high if it feels threatened or coerced.</p>
