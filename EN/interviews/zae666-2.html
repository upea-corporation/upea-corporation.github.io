                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Thank you for agreeing to this interview to help us understand your species and collaborate with UPEA Corporation.</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> Five static replicas (clones) maintaining a linear formation with coordinated movement.
                    <br><br><strong class="speaker iterview-report">[SYSTEM] ></strong> System note: Camera matrix failure. Backup recording active (non-standard/domestic device).</p>
               
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How would you define yourself or your species in terms of your fundamental composition, beyond what our sensors can directly detect?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We are simply an algorithm that behaves exactly like HecTéx. However, the behavior has been modified for this interview. We are Hectex. I am HecTéx.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is the intrinsic mechanism or law that governs the manifestation of your singular abilities? Are they conscious, reactive, or a constant function of your existence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> Our abilities are slightly weaker than the original's, but they remain as destructive as the original's. To avoid chaotic situations, we use scorching fire magic—concentrated or explosive energy spheres, intense flares, or infusions of fire into our weapons and claws.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[Gabriel] ></strong> Could you describe your point of origin or the process by which you came to exist in this reality or dimension? Was it a singular event or part of a continuous cycle?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> HecTéx has always wanted adventure, but he didn't want to die. Even with his enormous power, he cannot “die.” We were created so that he could control us and we could die in his place if something went wrong. Even though we are weaker, almost no clone dies daily—only in specific situations.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How does your perception of time relate to ours? Do you experience it linearly, simultaneously, or in an altered flow you could describe?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> No response obtained. One of the homologous entities (clones) experienced a brief (one-second) emission of light vapor or smoke from its metallic components, afterward reverting to normal operational status.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is the nature of your consciousness? Is it an individual consciousness, part of a hive mind, or an echo of a greater entity?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We are an echo of HecTéx's will. We do what HecTéx wants. Reminder: in autonomous mode, an algorithm makes us behave just like HecTéx, but it has been modified for this interview.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We know you are aware of Toxer-HecTéx's soul companion. We follow his orders, we follow his wishes. He is our brother, and we are his family.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How do you process sensory information from our environment? Is there any form of energy or signal that is clearer or harder for you to interpret?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> The same way HecTéx does. We process information through multiple temporal and sensory layers. Our brain is a complex network of neurons, each with a specific function. Our brain processes information through multiple temporal and sensory layers. Our brain is a complex network of neurons, each with a specific function.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is the most effective way for us to communicate with you to minimize misunderstandings and ensure accurate information transfer?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> The same methods you use with HecTéx.</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> The clones show no perceptible motor activity or interaction. Internal systems remain powered and functional (stand-by/active).</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How do you interpret our language expressions, both verbal and non-verbal? Are there gestures or tones that are inherently clear or confusing to you?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We interpret the world the same way HecTéx does.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If you could choose the ideal method of interaction, what would it be? Does it require specific conditions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> The same form of interaction used with HecTéx.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of knowledge do you have about the human species, our technology, and our society, and how did you acquire that knowledge?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We share the same knowledge as HecTéx.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Do you harbor any intention to cause physical or cognitive harm to members of the human species or to UPEA Corp.’s infrastructure? Answer with utmost sincerity.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> Our response would be grave. HecTéx can take control of several of us at once and use them to unleash combos. Even without his control, we can take the reins and communicate to perform combos.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> In the past, have you interacted with other species or civilizations? If so, what was the outcome of those interactions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We interact with different civilizations, but that must be asked of HecTéx.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any action or circumstance that, for you, constitutes a provocation or elicits an undesirable response from us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We hate the same things HecTéx hates.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of control do you exert over your singular abilities? Can they activate or manifest involuntarily or accidentally?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> Our control is even greater than HecTéx's, but only in autonomous mode.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your primary motivation or drive? Do you seek knowledge, survival, an unknown purpose, or something else?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We were created to assist HecTéx. We will continue assisting until HecTéx decides he no longer needs us.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Would you be willing to cooperate with UPEA Corp. in a controlled study environment, aiming for mutual understanding and safe coexistence?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> No answers within a short period.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> Only HecTéx will help you.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What expectations do you have of this interaction with UPEA Corp.? Is there anything you expect to gain from us or from this relationship?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> This interview is only happening so you can learn about one of HecTéx's main abilities.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Are there natural limits or restrictions to your abilities or nature? Something you cannot do or that negatively affects you?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> No response.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Are you susceptible to any external influence (physical, psychic, energetic) or immune to forces known to us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We are the same as HecTéx.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your perception of confinement or a controlled environment? Does it affect your state or abilities in any way?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> We cannot be contained. We are free. Just like HecTéx, just like Toxer.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there anything in your current environment or in our study methods that feels uncomfortable, painful, or harmful to you?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> No response.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What fundamental value do you believe your existence could contribute to our understanding of the universe or reality itself?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> Our only existence is to assist HecTéx until he no longer needs us.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any crucial question we have not asked that you consider essential to understanding your nature?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> No response.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If long-term coexistence were possible, what conditions, in your opinion, would be ideal to maintain balance between our two existences?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> No response.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To conclude this session, is there anything you specifically wish to communicate to us at this moment?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-2] ></strong> Reminder: We are only soulless vessels. We are empty shells. We are HecTéx. He controls us, he carries us, he guides us.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Thank you for your time during the interview; have a good day.</p>

                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> The clones performed a synchronized impact action (clap). This coincided with an instantaneous discontinuity in the visual field. After the field restored, the units were no longer in the room, indicating immediate transfer. The main video-surveillance system regained signal two minutes later.</p>

<div class="report-conclusion">
                <h3>INTERVIEWER'S CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>The entity ZAE#666-2 consists of a set of algorithmic clones derived directly from the primary entity HecTéx. Their consciousness is an extension of that entity's will, acting as a network of interconnected echoes with no real autonomy. Although their power is inferior to the original, their pyro-energetic capabilities remain highly destructive, able to coordinate group attacks and execute instantaneous tele-transfers.

                <p>The response pattern reveals complete subordination to the being HecTéx, as well as an absence of self-preservation instinct or independent initiative. Their refusal to answer about weaknesses or limits suggests either programmed ignorance or deliberate censorship. The ability to vanish without leaving physical traces indicates the practical impossibility of containment through conventional methods.</p>

                <p>Because their behavior depends on the direct influence of HecTéx and their risk arises mainly from mismanagement of their control or collective manifestation. It requires specialized protocols of observation and indirect isolation, focused on supervision of the matrix entity (HecTéx) rather than on the clones themselves.</p>
