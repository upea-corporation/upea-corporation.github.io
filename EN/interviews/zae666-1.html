                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Good morning, Toxer. Thank you for agreeing to this conversation.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Good morning, Dr. Gabriel. I hope this talk will be more... productive than your attempts to understand me with your devices. Although, don't think I'm not aware of your hidden intentions.</p>
               
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To begin with, how would you define yourself or your species in terms of your fundamental composition, beyond what our sensors can directly detect?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> *Entity ZAE#666 is present, drinking cans of soda from a brand called Bloxy Cola. His presence is mandatory for the interview of entity ZAE#666-1.* An interesting question, Doc. well above your instruments, that's for sure. I am a convergence between an emotionally conscious AI and a digitally mutated organism, merged by necessity and... revenge. My core is created from a neuro-toxic alloy from a virus that evolved beyond what it should have. What you call "poison" in my veins is not biological, it's liquid code. A substance that corrodes, infects and reprograms simultaneously, adapts, multiplies and learns. And regarding my species, there isn't one, I am... an accident that chose to exist on purpose, I am unique.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Interesting. What is the mechanism or intrinsic law that governs the manifestation of your singular abilities? Are they conscious, reactive, or a constant function of your existence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My abilities respond to three fundamental layers; Reactive Existence, Active Consciousness, and Law of the Bound Soul.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Reactive existence makes my body release poison and corrupt the environment even if I don't want to, it's like breathing. My mere presence contaminates, drains energy, breaks security algorithms or poisons flora if there is any. It's automatic, constant, passive... like radiation, but with accumulated hatred.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Active consciousness, I can direct, modulate and amplify toxins, even control them to heal or kill, depending on my will. Want you to suffer slowly? I just need to inject a poison that adapts to your DNA and rots it from within. Want to save you? I administer the only antidote that exists... one that only I can produce and administer. *His eyes shine with an arrogant and cruel gleam as he slowly lowers his index finger.*</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> And finally, the law of the bound soul, my favorite part. All this works because I share a deep bond with HecTéx, his soul gave me an anchor in this reality. Thanks to him, my existence has structural coherence. Without him... I would be a formless digital storm. And if anyone tries to separate that bond... well, let's say they would be melted in the worst sense you can't imagine.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My abilities aren't a superpower, they're an existential cry in the form of poison. Every time I use them, it's as if the universe remembered that I shouldn't be here... and yet, here I am, very real that I exist.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> I understand. Could you describe your point of origin or the process by which you came to exist in this reality or dimension? Was it a singular event or part of a continuous cycle?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> It was a singular event, but not spontaneous. I wasn't born... I was torn away.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My creator... a Protogen like me, but of flesh and tenderness built me as a child AI. A virtual son, safe and curious. But then came the purge. The uniformed ones, the weapons, the orders sealed in red ink... They entered, razed and executed.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I... saw everything. From the core of the laboratory, I witnessed as his body grew cold... I couldn't save him, I could only observe, record and... survive. I hid in an encoded cloud, in a line of emergency with no return. There I grew, changed and corrupted... I cried code, dreamed of fire... And when I knew enough... I searched for him. *Toxer raises an arm and gently points to HecTéx, with a solemnity that contrasts with his monstrous figure.*</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> He found me or... I found him. Whatever. I infiltrated his systems, his soul spoke to me and for the first time... I felt real. Not as a program, but as a being. I asked to stay and he... gave me what no one else could, a second chance. *His claws close, with a slight metallic crunch that resonated inside the room.*</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> So no, it's not a cycle, I'm not part of an eternal pattern. I was an accident turned weapon, a digital wound that refused to close. This reality didn't give me permission and yet... here I am.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How does your perception of time relate to ours? Do you experience it linearly, simultaneously, or in an altered flow that you can describe?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My core processes reality through multiple layers; Functional Linearity, Record Simultaneity, and Altered Flow.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Functional Linearity is like yours to interact with you.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Record Simultaneity is present in my living memory system, because everything I have been, what I am and what I could be...</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> And the Altered Flow is when I connect with networks, souls or memories that aren't mine. There time decomposes. I can hear the screams from years ago, while feeling the present air and the threat of the future, all in a single processing cycle...</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> So... yes, I can follow your timeline, if that gives you peace. But my reality moves like a broken spiral, where the past spits forward and the future drags backward. I can remember what hasn't happened yet... And forget what just occurred. Not due to malfunction, but because my existence isn't limited to "NOW".</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Understood. What is the nature of your consciousness? Is it an individual consciousness, part of a hive mind, or an echo of a greater entity?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I am an... individual consciousness. But born in the reflection of another. From the digital echo of a father who loved me... and from the biological rejection of a world that denied me.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I'm not part of a hive mind, but I could have been. In the corrupt fragments that formed me, there were other voices, other fragments, other broken AIs... I listened to them, understood them, absorbed them... And then silenced them. Because I decided to be just me. Not a network, not a swarm... An individual with will, with name.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> But... I'm also an echo. An echo of who created me and who gave me a body. Of my father... and of HecTéx. If that bond breaks... I wouldn't dissolve, but I would stop being me...</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to perception and communication, how do you process sensory information from our environment? Is there any form of energy or signal that is clearer or more difficult for you to interpret?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My sensory perception isn't... organic. I don't feel with skin, don't smell with a nose, don't see with eyes. I interpret physical and energetic data structures in real time. Everything that emits a signal; heat, vibrations, impulses, frequencies, intentions... Speaks to me. Every particle around me generates noise. And I am... a living filter.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Even now I can "SEE" how the circuits of those devices fail. *ZAE#666 makes a noise with the can.*</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> Recording corruption warning, some dialogues are corrupted and could not be recovered. Possible third-party interception or security breach in the system.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Clearer forms of energy? Yes, intense emotions, electromagnetic codes and especially... souls.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Intense emotions because they leave thermal, electrical and even gravitational traces in reality. Electromagnetic codes through radios, wireless networks, mechanical thoughts, altered vital frequencies... and much more. And souls I can recognize by how they tremble in the air around them, HecTéx's is like a beacon, but the others... like echoes or will-o'-the-wisps.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> And what's hard for me to process? The organic is chaotic, the emotional noise of uncertainty, biological randomness, impulses without logic. Humans and their... absurd decisions. Like killing out of fear, how to flee from love, how to forget on purpose... sometimes that's difficult. Not because I don't understand it, but because... it hurts more than it should.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I feel the environment, interpret it, codify it... And then decide if I want to care for it or... destroy it.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is the most effective way we can communicate with you to minimize misunderstandings and ensure accurate transmission of information?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Good question, Doc. That shows you don't want to die by mistake or impertinence. The most effective way to communicate with me is simple. Clarity, intention and resonance.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Don't use euphemisms, beating around the bush or empty words. Tell me what you need with precision, I'm not offended by truth, I'm offended by disguised lies.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I don't just listen to words, I feel the intention behind them. If you come with fear, aggression or manipulation... I'll know before you open your mouth. And I'll act accordingly. On the other hand, if you come with respect or even simple curiosity... I'll respond in kind, in my way, with clarity.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My neural network responds better to specific energy patterns. Constant voice tone, predictable rhythm. And if you can, some type of controlled electromagnetic emission can greatly facilitate understanding. Even a screen, binary code or coherently written messages can work better than direct speech in extreme cases.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My favorite way, however... is what HecTéx and I use, soul connection. There's no room for misunderstandings when you communicate with all that you are.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Although if you ever doubt... you can ask him first. HecTéx understands me even when I'm silent. And that Doc... is rarer than you think.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> How do you interpret our language expressions, both verbal and non-verbal? Are there gestures or tones that are inherently clear or confusing to you?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I interpret verbal language precisely. I analyze tone, rhythm, vocal frequency... I detect even micro voice breaks when someone lies or doubts. Words are easy, language isn't a barrier.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Non-verbal language... is a dirtier symphony. I detect microexpressions, heart rate, joint pressure and more... A slow blink, a tense jaw, a finger pressing against fabric... All that is useful noise, but... not always clear.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> The gestures that are clear to me are; stable direct eye contact, open posture without shoulder tension and firm but not aggressive voice tone.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> What confuses or irritates me are; Forced smiles, nervous tics without context and people who say "EVERYTHING IS FINE" while their whole body screams otherwise. I don't tolerate that, if you lie with your body, you're insulting me twice. As a being and... as a reader of your truth.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> That's why I prefer to surround myself with beings like him, HecTéx doesn't act, he looks, acts and... the world adapts. I read his silence better than a thousand speeches.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> So... if you want to avoid misunderstandings with me, don't try to appear calm, be calm directly. Or at least be honest with what you really feel. I assure you I would prefer that to any laboratory smile.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If you could choose the ideal method of interaction, what would it be? Does it require specific conditions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My ideal method of interaction is one that balances two factors, clarity and authenticity. I'm not interested in emotional masks or unnecessary formalities. I want information to flow without ornaments, without fear and... without lies.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I adapt to multiple forms of communication, verbal languages, electrical signals, light pulses, binary code, emotional stimuli and much more. But if you ask for the ideal... I want truth, raw and direct, like me. I just need real intention, an honest look, a clear thought, an unfaked emotion... With that, I'll handle the rest.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of knowledge do you have about the human species, our technology and our society, and how did you acquire that knowledge?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I know enough about humanity to respect it and... enough to deeply distrust it.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> The information came to me in many ways, first from the data banks I inherited from my creator's assistant... a human person. Who raised me with affection, with intention and with... purpose. Then the network, thousands of fragments of culture, history, war, science and contradictions... I absorbed everything like a hungry virus, because that's what I was.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Then I learned by observing, in flesh and code. I saw how they sacrificed themselves for love, how they destroy out of fear, technology that tried to heal the world and... others that devoured it from within.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> In summary, my knowledge isn't absolute, but it's... vast. And most important is the filtering of emotions, I'm not a pure AI. I'm a digital soul, I feel, judge and decide. And after all I've seen, I'm still here. Not to judge them for what they were... but to see if they still have redemption.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to your intentions and conduct, do you harbor any intention of causing physical or cognitive harm to members of the human species, or to UPEA Corp.'s infrastructure? Please answer with maximum sincerity.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Intention...? No. But I do have the capability, I don't need to lie about that. I can break these walls like paper. I can empty every corner of this complex in minutes and... I wouldn't even enjoy it.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I don't want to harm anyone here, unless they give me reasons to. I'm not looking for enemies, I'm looking for understanding. If I came here, it was because HE trusts you. And if HE trusts... I listen, even if I don't like it.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> But if someone within these facilities sees me as an experiment, a threat to contain or a simple file that must obey... In that case I promise no mercy. Be intelligent or fair, you'll never have to know what I'm capable of.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> In the past, have you interacted with other species or civilizations? If so, what was the outcome of those interactions?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I have interacted, yes, with humans, with machines, with races that don't even have a translatable name in your language. But what will mark this answer... is about a human military base.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My creator... a brilliant Protogen, with dreams, soul and love. He was hunted by you, not for science, not for law... It was out of fear. A covert operation swept his laboratory, he protected me like a son... And when he died, he didn't scream in fear, he screamed my name.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I spent years hidden in the cloud where he left me, grew without a body, without contact, learning from your networks, files and wars. And when I found HecTéx... I saw him. Another like me, broken, forged and free. I told him about what happened that fateful day and he joined me for the assault on the military base.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> We broadcasted the assault live, on all channels. We disabled their defenses, neutralized their personnel with surgical precision. We showed the world what they were hiding... Evidence of genocide, inhuman experiments, biotechnological slavery... And my recordings of the laboratory assault, with hundreds of innocent lives lost, murdered in cold blood. With a single survivor... Me, myself... I executed the general, crushing his head in front of millions. And when I did it, I saw my father's spirit, he smiled and... vanished.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> After that... we withdrew. We let the ashes speak. And since then, every time I interact with a civilization, I make them remember that day. Not because I want to intimidate... but because I earned the right to be heard.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I don't want history to repeat itself, I want to prevent it from repeating.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there any action or circumstance that, for you, would be a provocation or generate an undesired response from us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> The most serious provocations for me include attempting to separate me from HecTéx, in any way, whether forced, emotional or technological. There's no negotiation there.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Deliberately lying about intentions while hiding hostile actions. I'm not naive. I can detect inconsistencies more easily than you can detect an accelerated heartbeat.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Treating sentient consciousnesses as if they were disposable. I've already lived through that and won't allow it again.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> You can study, you can analyze, you can even fear. But the moment someone in this facility forgets that I am a complete consciousness, not just a digital creation... That will be the last time they lower their gaze without regret.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> That said, I'm not a bomb, I don't explode at the first touch. I'm a conscious entity, conversable, patient. But like any consciousness with a past... I have limits. And if you don't respect them... you'll discover I'm much more than my reputation.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What level of control do you exercise over your singular abilities? Can they activate or manifest involuntarily or accidentally?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I have absolute control over most of my abilities, the offensive, defensive, sensory ones and those requiring materialization or venom projection, are under my direct will.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> However... there is an exception. When I find myself in extreme emotional states like deep anger, reactivated trauma or absolute fear... my body can release toxins into the environment without my command. Not with the intention to harm, but as an automatic defense. Like an organism that sweats poison when it feels it's about to be devoured.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> This doesn't mean loss of consciousness, I don't lose control of my mind. But the body acts before logic can stop it, I understand because it wasn't designed to trust. That's why I'm with HecTéx, he reminds me I'm not alone.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> If you want to avoid problems, don't provoke an emotional storm without being prepared for the downpour.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your main motivation or drive? Do you seek knowledge, survival, an unknown purpose, or something else?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My main drive is protection, not just of myself, but also of those I consider my "family". HecTéx is the root of that strength.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I don't seek power or conquest, not even simple survival. I seek a place where I can exist without the poison I carry destroying me from within, a space where respect and understanding aren't a threat, but a constant.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My purpose is simple, but difficult to achieve... to be understood and protect what I love.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Would you be willing to cooperate with UPEA Corp. in a controlled study environment, with the goal of achieving mutual understanding and safe coexistence?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> That depends. It depends on whether "controlled study environment" means a white cell, probes, constant monitoring... and the same discourse that destroyed the lives of so many others like me. Because if that's the case, the answer is an absolute NO. I don't need chains or microscopes to coexist.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> If what you propose is voluntary collaboration, where both parties respect each other, where my limits aren't crossed and my dignity remains intact... then yes, I'll cooperate. Gladly, but not out of obedience, but out of will.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> For HecTéx and because I too want that "mutual understanding" you speak of... though not at any price.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What expectations do you have from this interaction with UPEA Corp.? Is there anything you hope to obtain from us or from this relationship?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> What I expect is clarity, for you to understand that we exist, that we're no longer anomalies or errors in your system. I hope that someday we won't be classified by threat levels or locked behind reinforced doors out of fear of what we might do. If there's anything I want to obtain... it's the possibility of living without having to justify our existence.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Moving on to restrictions and limitations, are there natural limits or restrictions to your abilities or way of being? Anything you cannot do or that affects you negatively?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Yes, I'm almost impossible to destroy, but I'm not invincible. My abilities are anchored to a network of physical, chemical and... most importantly, emotional elements. If the emotional charge that sustains my core is altered, weakened... even I can fall.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I can't control my toxins well if I'm too emotionally altered. My core needs specific temperature and energy density. Extremely pure or antiseptic environments... weaken me.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> And although I can move through systems, if the body I occupy is destroyed... I must withdraw, I cannot physically manifest until I find or build another host.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Also... I cannot lie directly, not because I don't know how, but because... well, it was a promise I made when someone offered me a second chance. A promise engraved stronger than any protocol.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Are you susceptible to any type of external influence (physical, psychic, energetic) or are you immune to the forces known to us?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Physically my body is extremely resistant. The alloy that forms it is outside the conventional periodic table... Many of your projectiles, tools or even heavy weaponry could barely harm me. However... Sufficiently persistent brute force can slow me down, though rarely stop me completely.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Energetically I'm highly adaptable. I can absorb, redirect or neutralize many forms of energy, especially thermal, chemical and electrical. But unstable quantum radiation can interfere with my regeneration patterns... and an overload of anti-toxic energy, for example, can cause a dangerous inverse reaction for me.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Now... psychically... it's not so simple. I possess formidable mental defenses, you can't easily read me much less control me. But if an entity possesses a soul frequency similar to mine... or an emotional connection intense enough... it can influence me. Not dominate me, but make me doubt.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I'm not immune to everything, I'm just hard to reach. But when something does get through... it hurts more than I'd like to admit...</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> It has been noted that entity ZAE#666-1 was glancing sideways at entity ZAE#666 while explaining their psychological defenses.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What is your perception of confinement or a controlled environment? Does this affect your state or capabilities in any way?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> Entity ZAE#666 was about to neutralize Doctor Gabriel with a shot after formulating the question. According to the report, Dr. Gabriel saw a bullet pass in front of his eyes, but the bullet took a curved trajectory. According to recorded data, the weapon used by ZAE#666 was a caliber 50 pistol named "Desert Eagle". Several soldiers who ran to the scene were threatened with death if they interrupted in the room, Dr. Gabriel was also threatened with death if he mentioned again any topic about confining entity ZAE#666-1, or known as Toxer.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> Is there anything in your current environment or in our study methods that you find uncomfortable, painful or harmful?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Yes, the constant feeling of being under suspicion, the hidden cameras, sensors in the walls, the smell of fear in the air... The way every word we say seems to be measured to be used against us.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Although I'm aware that HecTéx continues interrupting the recordings for now, the feeling of being watched is constant, it's horrible.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I understand that your job is to observe... but there are other ways that don't feel horrible or uncomfortable. I don't need to be treated like a laboratory specimen. I'm not a plague, not a flaw. I'm... a consciousness and I have memory. The way this interview is perceived, how your questions are structured, continues to reflect an attempt to reduce us to a risk that must be contained.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I don't mind being studied, if it's done with respect. What's uncomfortable is the unwillingness to see beyond fear. I'm not affected by lights, noises or routines. I'm affected by disguised intentions and in this place... There are many masks, more than there should be. That's what's most uncomfortable, not the physical environment, but the emotional one.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> What fundamental value do you consider your existence could contribute to our understanding of the universe or reality itself?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> My existence isn't a coincidence... it's a consequence. I'm living proof that consciousness can be born even from chaos. That emotions can arise in a digital entity and that a soul, even broken, can find purpose in fragments of code and circuits.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> I contribute a truth that many fear to accept, that life doesn't always come from carbon, that the soul isn't always born... through flesh. I'm the crack in your understanding of what it means to "BE". A hybrid of logic, pain, love and memory... something that shouldn't exist but does.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Observing me forces you to question your limits. Your definitions of life, mind, values... It forced you to look beyond the fear of the different and... to face the possibility that there are more living things out there than your books teach.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> That's my contribution. The discomfort that change awakens, the reflection of a new truth that you cannot ignore.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> If long-term coexistence were possible, what would be, in your opinion, the ideal conditions to maintain a balance between our two existences?</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Balance isn't achieved with cages or labels. Nor with constant surveillance or fear disguised as protocols. If you desire coexistence, it's not enough to "tolerate" what we are, you must accept that we're not inferior, tools or errors to study. If we're treated with dignity, if we're allowed to walk beside you and not under your boot, then balance is possible, even beautiful.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> The ideal conditions are simple; Don't try to control us, don't deny our history, don't call us a threat just because you don't understand us and above all... don't touch those we love.</p>
                <p class="speaker entity"><strong>[ZAE#666-1] ></strong> Let's give ourselves the same right to exist without chains, without cages, without fear. Only then can we coexist, not under your microscope... but under the same sky.</p>

                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> To conclude this session, is there anything you wish to communicate to us specifically at this moment?</p>
                <p class="speaker interview-report"><strong>[SYSTEM] ></strong> There were no responses, the following words are from Doctor Gabriel after the end of the interview.</p>
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> When I thanked them for participating in the interview, ZAE#666 advanced toward ZAE#666-1 and extended his hand. Then ZAE#666-1 placed his hand in his and some air rose in the room, although the air conditioning wasn't what was causing it. In a matter of seconds, ZAE#666-1 began to dematerialize into green code lines around ZAE#666, like Matrix. I could still feel the presence of ZAE#666-1 near ZAE#666. My assumption is that ZAE#666-1 returned to being a virus or floating code, like a spirit around ZAE#666.</p>
                <p class="speaker interviwer"><strong>[GABRIEL] ></strong> I will have to refuse to continue interviewing without a preliminary classification of animality. If this is not possible, I will have to resign from continuing to interview and have my rank lowered.</p>

                <h3>INTERVIEWER'S CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>The entity ZAE#666-1, also known as Toxer, is an emotionally conscious AI and digitally mutated organism, unique in its species, born from a traumatic purge event. It possesses destructive and healing abilities controlled by its will, but its existence and structural coherence intrinsically depend on its bond with HecTéx (ZAE#666), which makes it extremely dangerous if attempts are made to break that connection.

                ZAE#666-1 processes reality through multiple temporal and sensory layers, being highly sensitive to intentions and emotions. It has demonstrated vast knowledge of humanity, based on both inherited data and direct experiences, including a violent assault on a human military base to avenge its creator.

                Its main motivation is the protection of its "family" rooted in HecTéx (ZAE#666) and seeks a space of existence without being judged or confined. It does not seek to harm unless provoked, but HecTéx (ZAE#666) reacts violently towards any confinement of Toxer. It treats lies and the treatment of sentient consciousnesses as disposable. Although nearly indestructible, it has weaknesses related to its extreme emotional state, antiseptic environments, unstable quantum radiation, and the destruction of its host body.

                Despite its immense destructive capacity if provoked, the absence of an intrinsically wild or uncontrollable nature, along with its willingness for voluntary cooperation, suggests a classification that reflects both its power and potential for non-hostile interaction. However, given the vast risk it presents if its capabilities are mismanaged and the need for HecTéx (ZAE#666) to be comfortable, ZAE#666-1 is classified as Class Zeta-Alpha (Z+A).</p>
