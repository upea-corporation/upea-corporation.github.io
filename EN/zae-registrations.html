        <h2>Terms and Conditions for Zoomorphic Anthropoid Entities (ZAE) Registration</h2>

        <h3>1. Purpose of Registration and Use of ZAE Data</h3>
        <p>
            By registering a Zoomorphic Anthropoid Entity (ZAE) with UPEA Corp., you authorize us to use the information and data related to said ZAE for future publication and display on our website.
            This includes, but is not limited to, descriptions, characteristics, images (if provided and comply with our policies), and any other relevant details that contribute to the public profile of ZAEs.
            The goal is to create an accessible database that promotes the diversity and knowledge of ZAEs registered on our platform.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Privacy of User Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
            UPEA Corp. is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of our users' personal information.
            Any personal data provided during the registration process, such as your name and contact information, will be treated with the strictest confidentiality. Email is a mandatory field in the form to enable us to contact you.
            This information will be used <strong>solely and exclusively</strong> for contact purposes related to ZAE registration and essential communications from UPEA Corp. It will not be used for marketing purposes or user data sales.
            Under no circumstances will your personal information be shared, sold, or distributed to third parties without your explicit consent, except where required by law.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Legal Bases for Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            The processing of personal data and ZAE information is governed by the following organic laws, ensuring the legality and transparency of our operations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Personal Data Protection and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD):</strong> This law adapts Spanish legal framework to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It establishes the principles, rights, and obligations regarding data protection, including consent for processing, rights of access, rectification, deletion, limitation of processing, portability, and opposition.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR):</strong> As directly applicable European regulation, the GDPR establishes a unified framework for data protection in the EU. UPEA Corp. complies with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Content Validation Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure the integrity and purpose of our database, UPEA Corp. reserves the right to not approve or reject any registration containing information, responses, or content (including images) deemed vulgar, offensive, or inappropriate. Similarly, registrations including images of real human persons will not be accepted, as our platform's purpose is the registration of Zoomorphic Anthropoid Entities.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Right of Rectification and Content Removal</h3>
        <p>
            Acknowledging your control over the information you provide, you have the right to request rectification or removal of your ZAE's data published on our website, as well as the deletion of your personal contact information.
            To process your modification or deletion request, it is <strong>mandatory</strong> to contact us from the email address you used in the registration form. For faster and more effective verification, you may attach a screen recording showing the original registration process.
            Additionally, you have the right to request the deletion of your ZAE entity's interview to redo it if desired.
            If at any time you change your mind or wish to withdraw your content or data, you can contact us through the following email: <u>upea.corp@hotmail.com</u></a>
            We will process your request within a reasonable timeframe, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Form Response Copies</h3>
        <p>
            The email provided in the Google Forms form is a mandatory field and will serve as the primary method of authenticity in case verification of information or registrant identity is required. For this purpose, we accept screen recordings made during form completion as additional proof of authenticity, as they demonstrably prove data ownership. However, under no circumstances will screenshots or images be accepted, given their ease of manipulation and lack of contextual information.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Modifications to Terms and Conditions</h3>
        <p>
            UPEA Corp. reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time.
            Any changes will be effective immediately after their publication on this page.
            Users are recommended to periodically review this section to stay informed of updates.
            Continued use of our services after the publication of modifications constitutes acceptance of such modifications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>8. Questions and Contact</h3>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or need clarification about these Terms and Conditions, you can contact our team. We are available to address your concerns through the official contact email or through any of the social media channels available in the footer.
