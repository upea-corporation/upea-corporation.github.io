            <h2>First Design of the Website</h2>
            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: 16 of May of 2025 (16:50 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>The initial design of the website marked the starting point for UPEA Corp. in its digital development. Although this first prototype was simple and rudimentary, it set the foundation for a significant evolution. From this first iteration, a more attractive design was achieved, and the organization was expanded to accommodate the creation of additional pages.</p>

            <p>In the search for a slogan that would adequately represent UPEA Corporation, various sources were explored, including existing references and popular concepts in the realm of fandoms. For a period, the slogan <strong><u>"Anthropomorphic Animals Are... Enhanced Humans?"</u></strong> was considered. However, after further evaluation, it was decided to adopt <strong><u>"We Don't Hunt, We Study and Contain"</u></strong> as the official slogan of UPEA Corp., considering it more appropriate and representative of the organisation's identity.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> On May 20, 2025, at 19:41 UTC, a change was made to the slogan of UPEA Corporation. The phrase "We Don't Hunt, We Study and Protect" was officially adopted as a permanent change, as it was considered the option that best defined and represented the mission and values of our organization.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: 18-20 of May of 2025</u></p>
            <p>After a series of design adjustments, the initial development of the UPEA Corp. website began to take shape. At this stage, the site was hosted free of charge on the <strong><u>Netlify</u></strong> service. However, at that time, access to this development version was limited to a small number of people. It should be noted that the main information about UPEA Corp. was located on the home page, unlike its current location in a dedicated section.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> On May 18, 2025, at 14:43 UTC+2, an attempt was made to relocate the navigation menu section to a vertical layout. However, after evaluation, it was determined that the horizontal and centered position at the top of the page was the most appropriate option.</p>

            <p>Previously, containment measures had been implemented for each ZAE. However, due to the absence of a clear organization in the containment protocols and an unsuccessful attempt to establish them, these measures had to be removed. This decision also aligns with the adoption of the phrase "Protect", which reflects an approach that does not include containment.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: 22 of May of 2025 (13:05 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>UPEA Corp. has implemented a proprietary text encoding system, designed based on existing encoding principles. We currently have three different encodings for specific information. Initially, there was only one system with operational flaws and a Matrix-themed design that inserted a false character into the encoding. Although the decoding was correct, these shortcomings forced us to completely redesign the system, while retaining the original Matrix aesthetic.</p>

                <img src="../image/desechos/codex/upea-codex-old-image1.webp" alt="">
            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Prior to the implementation of the "ALPHA" encoding system, which had security limitations (even with the insertion of a false character), the "UPEA Codex" subdepartment was established. This initiative aimed to expand and improve our encoding capabilities.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: 16 of May of 2025 (12:22 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>The original logo or icon of UPEA Corp. was conceived based on the figure of a jaguar and robotics elements. This was the first design used during the initial stages of the website development. It is worth noting that, in the lower part, the logo incorporated the name "UPEA" with a custom metal typography.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Originally, the design in question was intended to serve as a cover for an interactive book with wiki functions about EAU (Entidades Antropomórficas Únicas) and in English it would be UAE "Unique Anthropomorphic Entities", and not as a logo or icon of an organization. At that time, a few days later, a more professional web development started, mainly a closed website for close friends.</p>

            <p>UPEA Corp. considered the implementation of informative audios on its website. However, this idea was later discarded. It was predicted that informative videos would be published on UPEA Corp.'s official YouTube channel.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> On June 2, 2025, after extensive research on the format and considering the limited experience in producing them, the idea was discarded. Currently, its implementation is considered as a possibility for a long-term future, or even null.</p>

            <p>After evaluating two versions of the logo and icon, one with a background and another without, the second version was selected. This decision was made to enhance the professionalism of the brand and ensure a better visual integration in various supports. The logo and icon version with a background has been discontinued in favor of the version without a background, which optimizes convenience and professional integration of the design.</p>

            <p>In order to optimise content organisation, the “Postponed Updates” section has been removed.

            <p>After an evaluation, we have decided not to carry out a complete redesign of the UPEA Corporation website. At this moment, we do not consider it viable due to the volume of content.
