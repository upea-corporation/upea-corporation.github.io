            <p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is not a real employment registration. This form is part of a web-based Alternate Reality Game (ARG), in which UPEA Corporation is a fictional secret government entity. Your participation contributes to the game's narrative.</p>

        <h2>UPEA Corp. Employee Registration Terms and Conditions</h2>

        <h3>1. Purpose of Registration and Employee Data Usage</h3>
        <p>
            By registering as an employee at UPEA Corporation, you authorize us to use the information and data provided to be implemented in UPEA Corporation's narrative universe. This information, including your description, characteristics, and any other relevant details, will contribute to the creation of your employee file.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Personal Information Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            UPEA Corp. is committed to protecting our users' personal information privacy. Any personal data provided during the registration process, such as your name and email address, will be treated with the strictest confidentiality. Email is a mandatory field so we can communicate with you.
            This information will be used <strong>solely and exclusively</strong> for contact purposes related to your registration and essential UPEA Corp. communications. It will not be used for marketing purposes or user data sales.
            Under no circumstances will your personal information be shared, sold, or distributed to third parties without your explicit consent, except where required by law.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Legal Bases for Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            Personal data processing is governed by the following laws, ensuring the legality and transparency of our operations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Personal Data Protection and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD):</strong> This law establishes the principles, rights, and obligations regarding data protection, including consent for processing, rights of access, rectification, processing limitation, portability, and opposition. Given the nature of our narrative universe, and with your explicit consent, the right of deletion is excepted to ensure the integrity of the story.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR):</strong> As directly applicable European regulation, the GDPR establishes a unified framework for data protection in the EU. UPEA Corp. complies with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality. Under Art. 85 of the GDPR on "Processing and freedom of expression and information," the narrative purpose is considered to justify data retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Duration of Participation</h3>
        <p>
            During the registration process, you will have the option to select how long you wish to be part of UPEA Corporation's narrative universe as an employee. This choice helps us plan the narrative and integrate your character into the story.
        </p>

        <h3>5. The Interview: Purpose and Storage</h3>
        <p>
            The registration interview's main purpose is to evaluate your suitability for the corporation department you wish to join. A copy of your interview will be stored in UPEA Corporation's database during your stay as an active employee in the narrative universe.
        </p>

        <h3>6. File Management and Participation Withdrawal</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to request rectification of information in your employee file, as well as modification of certain registered data. For this, it is <strong>mandatory</strong> to contact us from the email address you used in the registration form. For faster and more effective verification, you can attach a screen recording showing the original registration process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Acknowledging that UPEA Corporation is an Alternate Reality Game, you have the right to leave the narrative at any time. If you decide to stop being part of the UPEA Corporation universe as an employee, your registration will not be deleted, but your file published on the website, as well as the interview copy in our database, will be redacted using our exclusive <strong>Codex System</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Form Response Copies</h3>
        <p>
            By accepting the Terms and Conditions, you consent to us processing your registration through Google Forms. The provided email is a mandatory field and will serve as the primary authentication method if verification of information or registrant identity is requested. For this purpose, we accept screen recordings made during form completion as additional proof of authenticity, as they demonstrably prove data ownership. However, under no circumstances will screenshots or images be accepted, given their ease of manipulation and lack of contextual information.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Terms and Conditions Modifications</h3>
        <p>
            UPEA Corp. reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately after their publication on this page. Users are advised to periodically review this section to stay informed of updates. Continued use of our services after the publication of modifications will constitute acceptance of such modifications.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Questions and Contact</h3>
