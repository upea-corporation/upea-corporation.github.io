        <h2><u>FUNDAMENTAL NOTICE AND NARRATIVE SCOPE</u></h2>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The registration process (ZAE, Employee, Feedback) at <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> is part of a fictional and narrative project. <strong>Under no circumstances is the entry of real personal data allowed</strong> (identifiable full name, addresses, identifiable photographs, phone numbers, personal emails, personal identifiers, or any data that allows a real person to be identified).</p>

        <p>If <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> identifies real personal data in a registration, it will be <strong>immediately deleted</strong> and the registration will be invalidated. The user must redo the registration with fictional or narrative information. <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> will not retain real personal information under any circumstances, except when expressly required by law.</p>

        <p><strong>Registration conduct standard:</strong> Severe insults, vulgar content, partisan politics, or extreme sensitivities are prohibited; maintain narrative coherence and respect to preserve the lore without unnecessary restrictions; sensitive content will be immediately denied.</p>
        
        <h3>1. ZAE REGISTRATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>The information associated with a Zoomorphic Anthropoid Entity (ZAE) (text, fictional images, narrative metadata) may be published on the Wiki and other project media for narrative and cataloging purposes. This information will not be sold or rented to third parties outside the project.</p>

        <p><strong>Images and visual content:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No images of real people or backgrounds that allow personal information to be inferred (location, signs with names, screens with data, windows with identifiable landscapes, etc.) are accepted.</li>
            <li>Cosplays are only allowed if they correspond to Pseudo/Semi-Human species that do not allow real people to be identified.</li>
            <li>Backgrounds with neutral accessories are allowed; avoid open windows showing identifiable landscapes or buildings.</li>
            <li>AI-generated images are only allowed if they include a <strong>visible watermark</strong> indicating their origin (recommended: center of the image with readable opacity).</li>
            <li>Once a username is registered for the first time in any previous registration, that username will continue to be used even if the user changes it in a new registration; if the user wishes to change it, it will be changed in all related registrations if the new username is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>ZAE Interviews:</strong> Interviews conducted as part of a ZAE registration are part of the narrative content and, as a general rule, <strong>will not be subject to rectification or modification</strong> once incorporated into the lore or published. However, if the owner of the entity requests the complete deletion of their ZAE, <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> will proceed to delete the entity and related interviews as requested and in accordance with this document.</p>

        <p><strong>Social media:</strong> The user may choose to include links to social media in the ZAE file. <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> is not responsible for changes in usernames or URLs; the user must communicate such changes for manual updating.</p>

        <h3>2. EMPLOYEE REGISTRATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>The Employee registration is an internal file with narrative value for <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong>. The entry of real personal data is not allowed under any circumstances. If a user enters real personal data, the registration will be deleted and the user must redo it with fictional data.</p>

        <p><strong>Images and validation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Images of real people are not allowed under ordinary circumstances.</li>
            <li>An image in cosplay of the department assigned by <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> may exceptionally be accepted, always subject to review and validation by the team; after validation, the user will be notified. Or, if the user has uploaded an image of their employee character in casual attire, it may be accepted.</li>
            <li>AI-generated images are only accepted if they include a visible watermark identifying their origin.</li>
            <li>The employee's face will be censored only if the user decides to leave the project; while the user is part of the project, the file may display the validated image (according to the above rules).</li>
            <li>Once a username is registered for the first time in any previous registration, that username will continue to be used even if the user changes it in a new registration; if the user wishes to change it, it will be changed in all related registrations if the new username is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Employee Interviews (private and archived):</strong></p>
        <p>Interviews conducted during the Employee registration process <strong>will not be published on the website</strong>. If the user leaves the project as an employee of <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong>, such interviews will be <strong>archived, redacted, and encoded</strong> using an exclusive four-layer encoding system located outside the UPEA Codex platform, guaranteeing their public inaccessibility. Only authorized persons (developer, owner, and a very limited number of designated responsible parties) may access such information through established internal processes.</p>

        <p>The Employee file is not publicly deleted; it remains subject to the described encoding for historical/narrative purposes. However, <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> will comply with mandatory legal obligations if required by the competent authority.</p>

        <h3>3. FEEDBACK REGISTRATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>Feedback (suggestions, error reports, ratings) is used to improve the site and add features. All feedback information will be treated with the utmost discretion within the project and will not be sold or rented to third parties.</p>

        <p><strong>Restriction on personal data:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Entering real personal data in the feedback form is prohibited under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>If real personal data is detected in feedback, it will be immediately deleted and will not be archived; the user must resubmit their feedback without personal information.</li>
            <li>Aliases or fictional names are allowed as identifiers, as long as they do not allow a real person to be identified.</li>
            <li>Once a username is registered for the first time in any previous registration, that username will continue to be used even if the user changes it in a new registration; if the user wishes to change it, it will be changed in all related registrations if the new username is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Publication options:</strong> In the feedback form, the user may choose whether their comment is published or not, and whether it is displayed anonymously or identified (identification via non-personal alias).</p>

        <h3>AUTHENTICATION, MODIFICATION, AND DELETION PROCESS</h3>
        <p>To exercise rights (rectification, deletion, access, restriction, objection, portability) or to request changes related to a registration, the owner must contact <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> via UPEA Corporation's email.</p>

        <p><strong>Ownership verification:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary method:</strong> Send the request from the email address used in the original registration.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative method:</strong> In exceptional cases, provide non-sensitive documentation that allows accrediting authorship of the registration if a video is shared during the second section after accepting the Terms and Conditions. UPEA Corporation may deny requests if verification is insufficient.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>RETENTION AND DELETION</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ZAE Registration:</strong> Right to rectification and deletion in accordance with applicable regulations. ZAE interviews, once incorporated into the lore, will not be modifiable unless the complete deletion of the ZAE is requested by the owner.</li>
            <li><strong>Employee Registration:</strong> The file is not publicly deleted; it is encoded in four layers and retained with very restricted access. Faces in images will be censored if the user leaves the project. UPEA Corporation will comply with legal obligations requiring other action.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Registration:</strong> It is only archived if it does not contain real personal data; otherwise, it will be invalidated and deleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>DATA PROTECTION AND APPLICABLE LEGISLATION</h3>
        <p><strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> declares its willingness to comply with applicable data protection regulations (<a href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=DOUE-L-2016-80807" class="main-link">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673" class="main-link">LOPDGDD</a>) and will attend legitimate requests from interested parties within the terms permitted by law. In the event of a conflict between these narrative policies and mandatory legal obligations, the law shall prevail and UPEA Corporation will adopt the necessary measures for compliance.</p>

        <h3>QUESTIONS, COMPLAINTS, AND CONTACT</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or wish to exercise your rights, you may contact <strong>UPEA Corporation</strong> via email: <a href="mailto:upea.corp@hotmail.com" class="main-link">upea.corp@hotmail.com</a>. You may also use the official social media or the Feedback form.</p>

        <p class="note">By submitting a registration (ZAE, Employee, or Feedback) you accept these terms and conditions in their current version.</p>
