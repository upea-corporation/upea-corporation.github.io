        <h2><u>FUNDAMENTAL NOTICE AND NARRATIVE SCOPE (ARG)</u></h2>
        <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The registration process to obtain “Employee” status or to create an Zoomorphic Anthropomorphic Entity (ZAE) within UPEA Corporation is part of a <strong>narrative and fictional project (ARG)</strong>. Registrations are intended to host <em>characters, fursonas, or creative material</em>. <strong>Under no circumstances is the entry of real personal data allowed</strong> (full name, addresses, identifiable photographs, phone numbers, personal e-mails, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            If UPEA Corporation detects real personal data in a registration, such data will be <strong>immediately deleted</strong> and the registration invalidated. The user must re-register using valid fictional/narrative data. UPEA Corporation will never retain real personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            UPEA Corporation may use the registered material (text, fictional images, and narrative metadata) for content production (videos, animations, articles, role-play sessions, and other formats). By submitting content, the user agrees that the material may be used in the project’s lore under the license conditions stated below.
        </p>

        <h3>1. ZAE REGISTRATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>
            The information associated with a ZAE Entity (text, narrative data, and fictional images) <strong>will not be sold or rented</strong> to third parties for commercial purposes outside the project. The information may be published within the Wiki or on other project media for narrative and cataloging purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Regarding images in the ZAE registration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>No images of real people are accepted, nor images that include background information allowing sensitive personal data to be inferred (place of residence, names, texts, etc.).</li>
                <li>Cosplay is allowed only If the cosplay is of a <em>Pseudo</em>/<em>Semi-Human</em> and includes a human face.</li>
                <li>Backgrounds with accessories are permitted, provided they do not include open windows showing landscapes, nature, or buildings that could identify the location.</li>
                <li>AI-generated images are accepted to a certain extent, but must include a <strong>visible watermark</strong> in the center indicating that the image was generated by AI.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Images remain the property of their creator. By registering an image, the user grants UPEA Corporation a limited, non-exclusive, and revocable license to use the image <strong>within the context of the ZAE's digital file and in materials related to the project</strong>. Any other use requires an additional written agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Social Media:</strong> The user may choose whether to include their ZAE entity's social media accounts in the file. UPEA Corporation is not responsible for changes in usernames or associated URLs; if modified, the user must contact UPEA Corporation to update the information.
        </p>

        <h3>2. EMPLOYEE REGISTRATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>
            The information associated with an Employee (text, narrative data, and fictional images) <strong>will not be sold or rented</strong> to third parties for commercial purposes outside the project. The information may be published within the Wiki or on other project media for narrative and cataloging purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Employee" registration is considered an internal file with narrative value for UPEA Corporation. If a user includes real personal information, the registration will be deleted and must be redone. Once correctly registered with fictional data, the user may request rectification and cease to be part of UPEA Corporation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Regarding images in the Employee registration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Images of real people are not allowed under any circumstances.</li>
                <li>After reviewing the image, UPEA Corporation will contact the registering user to confirm its validity.</li>
                <li>The employee's face will only be censored if the user decides to leave the UPEA Corporation project as an employee.</li>
                <li>AI-generated images are also accepted, provided they bear a visible watermark clearly indicating their origin.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The file will not be completely deleted: it will be subjected to an <strong>exclusive four-layer encoding</strong>, inaccessible on the UPEA Codex page. Only the developer, the owner, and a very limited number of authorized persons will be able to encode and decode this information.
        </p>

        <h3>3. FEEDBACK REGISTRATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>
            Information associated with Feedback <strong>will not be sold or rented</strong> to third parties for commercial purposes outside the project. The information will remain isolated within the project and will not be shared with third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            UPEA Corporation may permanently archive Feedback records (suggestions, bug reports, and ratings) for project improvement and feature addition. The form will include an option for the user to decide whether their comment is published or not, and whether it is done anonymously or identified.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Restriction on personal data in Feedback:</strong> If the Feedback registration includes any real personal data (except for a fictional name or alias), it will be immediately deleted and will be neither valid nor archived. The user must redo the registration without including real personal information. If the user chooses to use their real name as a username, it will be understood that they have done so under their own responsibility and explicit consent by accepting these terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <h2><u>AUTHENTICATION, MODIFICATION AND DELETION PROCESS</u></h2>
        <p>
            To exercise any rights (rectification, deletion, access, etc.), the owner must contact the UPEA Corporation team through the contact email: <a href="mailto:upea.corp@hotmail.com" class="main-link">upea.corp@hotmail.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The applicant must prove ownership by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Method:</strong> Email address used in the original registration.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Method:</strong> Additional non-sensitive documentation confirming authorship (example: partial screenshot of the registration action). Video will only be used if the applicant provides it voluntarily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retention and Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ZAE Registration:</strong> Right to deletion and rectification in accordance with regulations. Images of real people are not accepted (except for cosplay of Pseudo/Semi-Humans or anthropomorphic characters under security conditions).</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Registration:</strong> Not deleted; encoded in four layers and the face is only censored if the user leaves the project. Accessible only by authorized personnel.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Registration:</strong> Only archived if it does not contain real personal data. If it includes personal data, it will be invalidated and deleted.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="note">
