            <h2>First Website Design</h2>
            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: May 16, 2025 (16:50 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>The initial website design marked the starting point for UPEA Corp.'s digital development. Although this first prototype was simple and rudimentary, it laid the foundation for significant evolution. From this first iteration, a more attractive design was achieved and the organization was expanded to accommodate the creation of additional pages.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: May 16, 2025 (16:52 - 17:31 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>In the search for a motto that would adequately represent UPEA Corporation, various sources were explored, including existing references and popular concepts in the realm of fandoms. For a period, the motto <strong><u>"Are Anthropomorphic Animals... Enhanced Humans?"</u></strong> was considered. However, after a later evaluation, it was decided to adopt <strong><u>"We Don't Hunt, We Study and Contain"</u></strong> as the official motto of UPEA Corp., considering it more appropriate and representative of the organization's identity.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> On May 20, 2025, at 19:41 UTC, a change was made to the UPEA Corporation motto. The phrase "We Don't Hunt, We Study and Protect" has been officially adopted permanently, as it is considered the option that best defines and represents the mission and values of our organization.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: May 18-20, 2025</u></p>
            <p>After a series of design adjustments, the initial development of the UPEA Corp. website began to materialize. At this stage, the site was hosted for free on the <strong><u>Netlify</u></strong> service. However, at that time, access to this development version was limited to a small number of people. It is worth noting that the main information about UPEA Corp. was located on the home page, unlike its current location in a dedicated section.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> On May 18, 2025, at 14:43 UTC+2, an attempt was made to relocate the navigation menu section to a vertical layout. However, after evaluation, it was determined that the most suitable option was to maintain its horizontal and centered position at the top of the page.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: May 29, 2025 (19:20 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>Previously, containment measures had been implemented for each ZAE. However, due to the absence of a clear organization in the containment protocols and a failed attempt to establish them, these measures had to be withdrawn. This decision also aligns with the adoption of the motto "Protect," which reflects an approach that does not include containment.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: May 22, 2025 (13:05 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>UPEA Corp. has implemented a proprietary text encoding system, designed from existing encoding principles. We currently have three different encodings for specific information. Initially, there was only one system with operational failures and a Matrix-themed design that inserted a fake character into the encoding. Although the decoding was correct, these deficiencies forced a complete redesign of the system, while preserving the original Matrix aesthetic.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Given the security limitations of the "ALPHA" encoding system (despite the implementation of a fake character), the "UPEA Codex" sub-department has been established. This initiative seeks to expand and improve our encoding capabilities.</p>

            <p class="date-discarded"><u>Date: May 16, 2025 (12:22 UTC+2)</u></p>
            <p>The original UPEA Corp. logo or icon was conceived based on the figure of a cheetah and robotics elements. This was the first design used during the initial phases of website development. It is worth noting that, at the bottom, the logo incorporated the name "UPEA" with a custom metallic-style typography.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Originally, the design in question was intended to serve as a cover for an interactive book with wiki functions about ZAE (Zoomorphic Anthropoid Entities), and not as a logo or icon for an organization. At that time, days later, professional web development began, mainly a private website for close friends.</p>

            <p>The implementation of informational audios about UPEA Corp. on the website was considered. However, this idea was later discarded. It is expected that informational videos will be published on the official UPEA Corp. YouTube channel.</p>
            
            <p>On June 2, 2025, the possibility of implementing informational audios was evaluated. After extensive research on the format and considering the limited experience in its production, the idea was discarded. Currently, its implementation is considered a very long-term possibility, or even non-existent.</p>

            <p>After evaluating two versions of the logo and icon, one with a background and one without, the latter was selected. This decision was made to enhance the brand's professionalism and ensure better visual integration on various media. The version of the logo and icon with a background has been discontinued in favor of the variant without a background, which optimizes the convenience and professional integration of the design.</p>

            <p>With the goal of optimizing content organization, the 'Postponed Updates' section has been removed.

            <p>After an evaluation, we have decided not to carry out a complete redesign of the UPEA Corporation website. At this time, we do not consider it viable due to the volume of content. We believe that the current design is more than adequate and functional, both visually and for the corporation's environment.</p>
