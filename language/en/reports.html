            <h4>Annual Report of Activity ZAE</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 22 of August of 2025 (19:25 UTC+2)</p>
            <p><strong>Type of Report:</strong> Attacks on the Installation Cala</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The UPEA Corporation facility at Cala was attacked by entity ZAE#000-1. This event was triggered by an unauthorised experiment conducted by a research team, which placed surveillance on the home of entity ZAE#000, provoking its fury. There was no serious damage to the facility, but the entire surveillance system was destroyed. During the attack, the entity's anomalous abilities were briefly studied, suggesting the need for further research for possible classification as class Zeta. Currently, an internal investigation has been opened to determine those responsible for the experiment and to reassess security protocols.</p>

            <h4>Annual Report of Activity ZAE</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 16 of August of 2025 (12:01 UTC+2)</p>
            <p><strong>Type of Report:</strong> New Information About EAZ</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Guards have reported something concerning about entity ZAE#666-1. It was reported that while entity ZAE#666-1 was eating the corpses of wild creatures, it looked up at the guards with an unsettling smile, and they heard the sound of its jaw crunching bones over a large pool of blood. As for the entity ZAE#201, it was noted that it engages in conversation in the cafeteria during some daily meals, and it was also noted that it prefers to eat fresh berries and wild fruits, although it has a strong craving for meat pizza.</p>

            <h4>Annual Report of Possible Vulnerability</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 5 of August of 2025 (08:13 UTC+2)</p>
            <p><strong>Type of Report:</strong> Technical Incident</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> During the working day, when starting the system to continue working on the UPEA Corporation website, a visual anomaly was detected in the project's image directory. It has been observed that the thumbnails in the folder are not rendering correctly, displaying a black background in the folder icon box. Although the possibility of unauthorised intervention or access by an ZAE entity has been considered, no conclusive evidence has been found to support this hypothesis. The most likely cause is believed to be an operating system malfunction or security breach. Therefore, the implementation of additional precautions to protect our systems from potential vulnerabilities exploited by EAZs is recommended.</p>

            <h4>Annual Report of Migration</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 5 of August of 2025 (13:08-21:05 UTC+2)</p>
            <p><strong>Type of Report:</strong> Migration of Files</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The migration of files to the UPEA Corporation GitHub organization repository has been successfully completed. The main technical challenge was ensuring compatibility with the private key, which was resolved by converting the original format to PKCS#8 using OpenSSL 3.0.17. The system is now fully functional.</p>

            <h4>Annual Report of Intrusion</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 19 of July of 2025 (14:10-14:21 UTC+2)</p>
            <p><strong>Type of Report:</strong> Unauthorized Access to Servers</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A unauthorized activity has been registered on the main servers of UPEA Corporation. After an exhaustive investigation, no information about the intruder's identity or origin has been obtained. It is presumed that the activity was carried out by third parties, although it is not specified whether it is a class Zeta entity. The unauthorized activity was limited to the period between 14:10 and 14:21 hours.</p>

            <h4>Annual Report of Intrusion</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 16 of June of 2025 (11:31 UTC+2)</p>
            <p><strong>Type of Report:</strong> Intrusion into the Rune Installation</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> At the UPEA Corporation's Rune facility, the presence of entity ZAE#666 was detected, which was recorded for only a few seconds before disappearing completely. The staff did not notice its presence. Simultaneously, significant interference was recorded during the completion of the interview with entity EAZ#201. Security recordings were corrupted for several minutes after detection. It is unknown whether there is a direct correlation between this event and the observed interference. Furthermore, it is unknown whether ZAE#666 and ZAE#201 are related, as ZAE#666 appeared to be interested in ZAE#201.</p>
